MIN_PEER_PROTO_VERSION could be a different value to disconnect from peers older than a specified version. This commit alone does not change any behavior.

To implement callbacks, a new CWalletInterface is defined in main, and implemented by wallet. As a result, together with a few more changes, we can break the dependency from init (and indirectly, from main) on wallet. Two functional cleanups were included as well, namely removing the behaviour where transactions "fFromMe" were always trickled (we shouldnt treat our own transactions differently, privacy leak) and removing the (apparently since-long broken) PrintWallets functionality.

3077	closed	sipa	This removes several globals (pindexBest, pindexGenesisBlock, hashBestChain, nBestHeight, nBestChainWork, vBlockIndexByHeight), and replaces them by chainBlocks, an instance of a new CChain class. CChain actually only wraps what was previously stored in vBlockIndexByHeight - all other variables are redundant and can be computed from that one. This is a preparation for a second iteration of headersfirst which Im implementing, which will add a second instance of CChain (chainHeaders) in addition to chainActive. This pull request shouldnt change any functionality. Since pindexGenesisBlock, hashBestBlock and nBestChainWork are now computed when needed rather than stored, there are potential edge cases in which no genesis block exists yet, and chainActive.Tip() returns NULL.

The commit doesnt completely remove default key functionality but removes the code that sets a new default key after a transaction when it received coins. Completely removing default key functionality is not that easy because it is used as stopgap in a few places - (in `CWallet::LoadWallet`) to determine whether this is the first run with this wallet. - (in `CReserveKey::GetReservedKey`) to return something when the keys are exhausted and keypool should be topped up However these stopgaps are not affected by this change. There will still be an initial default key, it will just never change.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/3074	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3074/comments	2013-10-10T13:08:56Z	2013-10-21T02:40:43Z

The commit does not remove RPC functionality from the `bitcoind` yet, this functionality should be deprecated but is left for a later version to give users some time to switch. To try to remove RPC client dependency on BDB and leveldb I - Moved HelpMessage from `init.cpp` to `util.cpp` - Split `bitcoinrpc.cpp` into `rpcprotocol.cpp`, `rpcclient.cpp` and `rpcserver.cpp` Still this was not successful. It turns out that `util.cpp`, through `Params().DataDir()` in `GetDataDir(fNetSpecific=true)` depends on the block chain parameters, and that way pulls in all the core files (`core.cpp`, `blockchain.cpp`) including the ones that need leveldb and BDB. Splitting `util.cpp` would be possible (as the RPC client only needs the un-specific data dir to get at the configuration file) although somewhat more thinking is required. This would result in many more changes so lets leave it for later. **Note:** This leaves the only usage of `fHaveGUI` left in wallet.cpp: which deals with the default key which we want to remove. After this, the variable can be removed from the core. This is outside the scope of this pull though.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/3072	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3072/comments	2013-10-09T11:06:11Z	2013-10-13T11:59:24Z

This patch sorts outputs by amount, ascending. **Pros:** - better readability of outputs **Cons:** - complexity of printing is n*log(n) instead of n (where n is number of outputs) - maybe question why to sort by amount and no by any other key (but I think that better any sort than no sort) For me, this is very useful.

3009	closed	gavinandresen	I finally got fed up enough with our lousy logging to do something about it. So: I replaced all instances of printf() in our code with either LogPrint or LogPrintf. LogPrintf("foo\n"); is a straight replacement for printf/OutputDebugStringf("foo\n"). It writes printf-formatted arguments to debug.log (or console if -printtoconsole). Use it for messages that should always go into debug.log (errors, startup info, etc). LogPrint("category", ...); is new-- it only logs if you pass a -debug=category flag. Run with multiple -debug= arguments to log more than one category (e.g. bitcoind -debug=net -debug=mempool ). I defined the following categories: net mempool rpc alert db addr addrman coindb rand If yall like this, feel free to add more categories, rename/combine these, etc.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/3009	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3009/comments	2013-09-18T10:50:08Z	2013-09-18T11:00:03Z
3008	closed	gavinandresen	This is part of my quest to eliminate hard-coded fees from the reference implementation. The first: Remove the rule that all outputs of free transactions must be greater than 0.01 XBT. Dust spam is now taken care of by making dusty outputs non-standard. I did not change the coin selection algorithm, it will still try to avoid creating outputs less than 0.01 XBT. That could be changed/simplified a release after this rolls out to miners/relay nodes (before then, there is too much risk your free transactions would never confirm). The second: Changes the maximum size of a free transaction that will be created from 10,000 bytes to 1,000 bytes. The idea behind this change is to make the free transaction area available to a greater number of people; with the default 27K-per-block, just three very-large very-high-priority transactions could fill the space. I did not change the relay policy for free transactions (yet); you can still send a 26,000 byte zero-fee transaction and it will be relayed and might be mined. This just stops somebody moving a lot of old coins from accidentally monopolizing the free transaction area when they would almost certainly be perfectly happy to pay the fee.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/3008	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3008/comments	2013-09-18T02:15:36Z	2013-10-20T06:01:47Z

If one target tries to build while the other is halfway through writing the .mk, the make ends up in an undefined state. Fix that by making one depend on the other.

2985	closed	theuni	This is the first in a line of PRs to address some of the concerns laid out in #2979. Rather than adding more trickery to deduce where test data should be found, I believe that this is the more reliable solution. This uses the same mechanism as QT to include their assets in the resulting binary rather than reading it from the disk at runtime. Untested as-yet on OSX, but I believe it should work fine there. Copied from the main commit: Advantages: - Tests become distributable. - Cross-compile friendly. Build on one machine and execute in an arbitrary location on another. - Easier testing for backports. Users can verify that tests pass without having to track down corresponding test data. - More trustworthy test results and easier quality assurance as tests make fewer assumptions about their environment. - Tests could theoretically run at client/daemon startup and exit on failure. Disadvantages: - Required hexdump build-dependency. This is a standard bsd tool that should be usable everywhere. It is likely already installed on all build-machines. - Tests can no longer be fudged after build by altering test-data.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2985	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2985/comments	2013-09-10T20:22:52Z	2013-09-17T01:11:51Z
2982	closed	gmaxwell	This also makes negative transaction versions non-standard. This avoids an issue triggered in block 256818 where transactions with negative version numbers were incorrectly serialized into the UTXO set. On restart nodes detect the inconsistency and refuse to start so long as a block with these transactions is inside the self-consistency check window, logging "coin database inconsistencies found". The software recommends reindexing, but reindexing does not correct the problem. This should be fixed by changing the chainstate serialization, but working around it seems harmless for now because the version is not used by any network rule currently. A patch free workaround is to start with -checklevel=2 which skips the consistency checks, but the IsStandard change is important for miners in order to protect unpatched nodes.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2982	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2982/comments	2013-09-09T09:19:35Z	2013-09-10T23:07:34Z

Id toyed with some other variations, but it seems like any formulation which results in an incentive stronger than making them not count will sometimes create incentives to add extra outputs so that you have extra inputs to consume later. The maximum credit is limited so that users dont lose the disincentive to stuff random data in their transactions, the limit of 109 is based on the size of a P2SH redemption with a compressed public key.

Sadly, my macbook busted last weekend (should be fixed in ~1wk), So I was not able to add the osx dmg build target as I had intended, nor the documentation for building on osx. Is anyone willing to help me out with the above? -- Here is the final go at an Autotools build system replacement. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the current system(s), providing the same features with no net changes. It can also live side-by-side with the old system while sharing the same build-related variables in order to facilitate a smooth transition. I hope the benefits are obvious enough: A single/shared build procedure, portability, ease of packaging, ease for downstreams, ease for repository maintainers, cross-compilation, etc. I dont vouch for Autotools in any way, in fact, this configure.am is downright ugly (mainly just because of mingw though), but its portable and well-established. This does away with the need for qmake, as the Makefile is capable of generating everything it needs in a portable way. Building from CLI: For Linux, assuming the dependencies have been met, the build procedure looks like this: ``` ./autogen.sh ./configure make ``` Same for OS X, but the pkg-config path needs to be hooked up from macports first: ``` echo "/opt/local/share/aclocal" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/aclocal/dirlist ``` For mingw its the same, but you will need to provide lots of paths in the form of: ``` ./autogen.sh export STAGING=/path/to/extracted/libs ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I$STAGING LDFLAGS=-L$STAGING --prefix=$STAGING --host=i586-mingw32msvc --with-qt-bindir=$STAGING/host/bin --with-qt-plugindir=$STAGING/plugins --with-qt-incdir=$STAGING --with-boost=$STAGING --with-protoc-bindir=$STAGING/host/bin make ``` In addition, there are helpers for qt and boost to help with finding some locations. Use ./configure --help to see the available options. Native windows built is untested, as I dont have a windows environment at my disposal. make check will run the unit tests and print the results. Ive done my best to avoid adding any new behavior or features, and I would much prefer to aim for feature-parity before making any improvements.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2943	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2943/comments	2013-08-27T03:26:49Z	2013-09-07T00:09:55Z

2884	closed	gavinandresen	The length of vectors, maps, sets, etc are serialized using Write/ReadCompactSize -- which, unfortunately, do not use a unique encoding. So deserializing and then re-serializing a transaction (for example) can give you different bits than you started with. That doesnt cause any problems that we are aware of, but it is exactly the type of subtle mismatch that can lead to exploits. With this pull, reading a non-canonical CompactSize throws an exception, which means nodes will ignore tx or block or other messages that are not properly encoded. Please check my logic... but this change is safe with respect to causing a network split. Old clients that receive non-canonically-encoded transactions or blocks deserialize them into CTransaction/CBlock structures in memory, and then re-serialize them before relaying them to peers. And please check my logic with respect to causing a blockchain split: there are no CompactSize fields in the block header, so the block hash is always canonical. The merkle root in the block header is computed on a vector&lt;CTransaction&gt;, so any non-canonical encoding of the transactions in tx or block messages is erased as they are read into memory by old clients, and does not affect the block hash. And, as noted above, old clients re-serialize (with canonical encoding) tx and block messages before relaying to peers.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2884	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2884/comments	2013-08-07T05:16:30Z	2013-10-20T06:03:04Z

2876	closed	sipa	This is a potential fix for the bug that causes several miner nodes to crash a few days ago. The problem: when a block is disconnected, the transactions in it are attempted to be moved to the mempool; if some of these are non-standard, this will fail. If there were transactions in the mempool already that depended one or more of those, they become orphan transactions - which breaks the mempools consistency assumption. In addition, this pull request adds a CTxMempool::check() method which runs an extensive consistency check on the mempool, and is called from several places when -checkmempool is passed (a non-documented flag).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2876	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2876/comments	2013-08-03T18:49:44Z	2013-08-16T01:51:06Z

This also fixes CVE-2013-4627 by always re-serializing transactions before relaying them. And I cleaned up the "tx" message-handling code a little (it was re-using inv and tx variables, which is error-prone and confusing).

2864	closed	dan-da	This patch enables one to configure a whitelist of RPC commands that can be called for each allowed client IP. Lets look at the motivating use case for this feature. Consider a website that accepts bitcoin payments using the bitcoind API directly. The webserver and bitcoind are on separate servers. It is desirable that the webserver be able to call getnewaddress() and gettransaction (or listtransactions). It is highly undesirable (security risk) that the webserver be able to call any of the send* commands or stop command, or probably others, especially because the public-facing webserver is the most likely target to be attacked and possibly compromised. At this point, lets not get distracted with a discussion about using hot wallets vs cold storage vs 3rd party API. Instead suffice to say that the website has a need to do this, but desires to be as secure about it as possible. It is also possible to envision more complex scenarios with various client IPs, each with differering requirements / permissions, or all the same, as in a pool of frontend webservers. Okay, so -rpcipcmds to the rescue. Now the site administrator can configure bitcoind to only allow desired RPC calls from the webserver IP. Any other command results in "Method not allowed for client IP." json-rpc error. ./bitcoind --help | grep rpcip -rpcipcmds=<ip>,<cmd> Allow only specific commands from specified IP address. <ip>,<cmd1>,<cmd2>,<cmd3>... Example bitcoin.conf usage: rpcallowip=192.168.2.200 rpcipcmds=192.168.2.200,getnewaddress rpcipcmds=127.0.0.1,getnewaddress,sendtoaddress,getinfo,stop,help Implementation Notes: 1) If an IP is allowed with rpcallowip but does not have an rpcipcmds entry then all commands can be used. 2) WildCards in IP are accepted. 3) Works with single command invocation and also batch invocation. 4) For batch invocation, all commands are checked before any command is called. So all or nothing. 5) Some might find the syntax a little funky. I considered using &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;cmd&gt; format, one per line, but rejected it because it requires specifying the same IP over and over. The CSV format enables &lt;ip&gt;,&lt;cmd&gt;,&lt;cmd&gt;,&lt;cmd&gt;... per line and is easy to read/grok and to parse. So that was my thought process. 6) This is my first bitcoind modification effort, and my first ever github pull request. Also, I am not a networking expert, and my C++ is very rusty. It is likely something could have been done better, code or pull request does not meet standards, etc. If so, my apologies in advance. The patch meets my needs so far, and I felt I should contribute it in case it can benefit others. Feel free to re-work, re-write etc as necessary. 7) -rpcipcmds is kind of hard to read. I originally called it rpcallowipmethods. But that didnt format nicely with the other commands in the help. This does. Testing: * Has been briefly tested with both single and batch invocation from localhost as well as a remote IP. Tested with IPv4 addresses only. * I did not create a unit test for it. Maybe could test with localhost.... remote IP seems hard.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2864	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2864/comments	2013-07-29T07:17:39Z	2013-08-15T05:13:07Z

(mainly I want to see what the pulltester thinks) Note that this is a safe implementation, not a 100% accurate one, for reasons mentioned in CMemPoolTx::calcPrioritySums() In addition the memoized approach cant directly handle the case where a transaction with a lot of outputs is made worthwhile to mine because of multiple children.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2814	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2814/comments	2013-07-04T10:29:04Z	2013-10-21T02:03:08Z

2805	closed	theuni	Changes since Round 1: - Rebased on current master - Moved configure to root srcdir, and added a Makefile there - Split into several Makefile.ams with recursive build [1] - Work towards building correctly under gitian - Fixed/verified several build scenarios - Fixed up make dist to work as a viable end-result packaging mechanism [2] 1. Personally I believe that splitting up the build is a major regression from RFC1. This was done by request here. Most projects end up spending lots of time moving in the opposite direction, as a recursive build tends to be slower, more complicated, and more-error prone. That proves to be the case here as well, but Ive attempted to handle it as gracefully as possible. 2. make dist can be used to produce a bootstrapped tarball with git information included, intended for distribution as an official source release. This is the equivalent of taking a fresh git clone, running ./autogen.sh, and taring up the result. This is the common procedure for autotools projects. At this point I consider it to be merge-ready, with the exception of verification of gitian descriptors and documentation. Presumably removal of the old makefile.* would coincide with updated documentation. Several things can be improved and cleaned up after merge (dealing with versioning, for example), but Ive tried to ignore these things as much as possible for the sake of a quick merge. Edit: Removed crazy markup that looked like yelling -- sorry. -- Here is the second go at an Autotools build system replacement. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the current system(s), providing the same features with no net changes. It can also live side-by-side with the old system while sharing the same build-related variables in order to facilitate a smooth transition. I hope the benefits are obvious enough: A single/shared build procedure, portability, ease of packaging, ease for downstreams, ease for repository maintainers, cross-compilation, etc. I dont vouch for Autotools in any way, in fact, this configure.am is downright ugly (mainly just because of mingw though), but its portable and well-established. Ive opted not to write the documentation yet, because I would like to see what comments/concerns come out of the first round of review before committing to anything. This does away with the need for qmake, as the Makefile is capable of generating everything it needs in a portable way. Qt-creator can be used with the Autotools plugin, and is working nicely. For those who wish to use it this way, install the Autotools plugin from the about menu, then open Makefile.am as a project. It handles the build procedure, so there is no need to mess with the command-line procedures listed below. Building from CLI: For Linux, assuming the dependencies have been met, the build procedure looks like this: ``` ./autogen.sh ./configure make ``` Same for OS X, but the pkg-config path needs to be hooked up from macports first: ``` echo "/opt/local/share/aclocal" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/aclocal/dirlist ``` For mingw its the same, but you will need to provide lots of paths in the form of: ``` ./autogen.sh CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/include -I/path/to/other/include" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/libs -L/path/to/other/libs" ./configure make ``` In addition, there are helpers for qt and boost to help with finding some locations. Use ./configure --help to see the available options. Native windows built is untested, as I dont have a windows environment at my disposal. Gitian should be working for win32 builds. Ive guessed at Linux but have not yet verified. make check will run the unit tests and print the results. Ive done my best to avoid adding any new behavior or features, and I would much prefer to aim for feature-parity before making any improvements.

2804	closed	sipa	As git provides a way to export a tarball given a commit, its very easy to add the creation of source releases, IMHO. We very much like people to build from git tags, but apparently this is hard or at least inconvenient for some infrastructure out there. I hope the overhead is minimal enough for those doing the release... This also disables the use of git-describe in exported source archives, as it results in a spurious error otherwise.

2802	closed	sipa	Changes: * Maintain a salt to perturbate the address index (protection against collisions). * Add support for address index entries in the block index, and maintain those if -addrindex is specified. It indexes the use of every >8-byte data push in output script or consumed script - or in case of no such push, the entire script. * Add a searchrawtransactions RPC call, which can look up raw transactions by address. I both hate and love this patch. I hate making it easy to build infrastructure that relies on a fully-indexed blockchain (which shouldnt be necessary), as it may remove the incentive to build more scalable solutions. On the other hand, in cases where the alternative is relying on a trusted third party, this approach is certainly preferable, and would allow an RPC-based blockexplorer, for example. A full -txindex=1 -addrindex=1 index is about 2.7 GiB now.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2802	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2802/comments	2013-06-27T22:50:29Z	2013-10-21T11:37:47Z

2798	closed	Michagogo	The process outlined in the current release-process.md uses pushd and popd, to dip into and return from directories. It starts in the directory that contains the gitian-builder, gitian.sigs, and bitcoin directories. It then changes directory to the gitian-builder directory, builds, puts the signature into gitian.sigs, and the build outputs zipped up in the gitian-builder directory. Then, it repackages the builds into stand-alone files, still within gitian-builder. Once thats done, the time comes to commit the signatures and then, once enough people have signed, to repackage the gitian zips. At this point, the document appears to assume youre already back in the initial directory, the one with the gitian zips (which are actually in gitian-builder), gitian.sigs and bitcoin directories. This edit addresses these issues, by putting the gitian zips in that top directory, and using that directory as the base camp, so to speak, from which the various directories are dipped into and returned from throughout the process.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2798	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2798/comments	2013-06-26T14:42:21Z	2013-07-07T16:19:07Z

2783	closed	sipa	In case no database exists yet, and -txindex(=1) is passed, we currently first check whether fTxIndex differs from -txindex (and ask the user to reindex in that case), and only afterwards initialize the database. By swapping these around (the initialization is a no-op in case the database already exists), we allow it to be born in txindex mode, without warning. That also means we dont need to check -reindex anymore, as the wiping/reinit of the databases happens before checking. Closes #2782.

Also a few related other changes: * Metadata can be overwritten. * Only GenerateNewKey calls GetTime(), as its the only place where we know for sure a key was not constructed earlier. * When the nTimeFirstKey is known to be inaccurate, it is set to the value 1 (instead of 0, which would mean unknown). * Use CPubKey instead of std::vector< unsigned char> where possible.

2767	closed	brandondahler	... of avoiding unnecessary header includes. Additionally alphabetizes and groups includes and forward declarations. Note: there are a large amount of changes that have been rebased onto the most recent master. I did my best to ensure that no code was functionally changed; however, a code review of all my changes would be advised. ### Theory By using [forward declarations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration), compilation speed can be increased in both incremental and full builds. Forward declarations suffice over having the full declaration in cases where the type that is being forward declared is only used as a reference or being pointed to, and the usage is not an [lvalue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_%28computer_science%29). By making these modifications, the total number of header files needed to compile any .cpp file is reduced. Fewer header files being included reduces the total amount of code that needs to be compiled for each .cpp file. ### Quantitative Results How much time does this actually account for? For bitcoind: ![Bitcoind Results](http://i.imgur.com/KNDcgBS.png) [This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnpjY4_hVstbdHllazg4MG80V1UtUTVqM0hfTUE3bEE&usp=sharing) spreadsheet shows detailed results for each of the different builds (note that there are multiple sheets in the spreadsheet), along with the interesting stats and graph for each. This data was generated automatically via the scripts [here](https://gist.github.com/brandondahler/5771108). ### Method * Go through each file, group each #include by type (see Order) and sort alphabetically * Using [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) with the [graphviz dots](http://www.graphviz.org/) extension * Go through each header, comment each #include individually and all headers that indirectly include the commented one * See if it can build with the #include commented, analyze errors to understand if they can actually be solved with forward declares * Remove, keep, or add a direct header to the required type, as needed. ### Order Most Generic // License text as first // lines #if defined(HAVE_CONFIG_H) #include "bitcoin-config.h" #endif #include "matching_file.h" #include "local_file1.h" #include "local_file2.h" #include "file_in_other_dir1.h" #include "file_in_other_dir2.h" #include <system1.h> #include <system2.h> #ifdef SOMETHING1 #include <system3.h> #endif #include "json/a_file.h" #include <library1.h> #include <library2.h> #ifdef SOMETHING2 #include <library3.h> #endif class ForwardDeclare1; class ForwardDeclare2; namespace SomeNamespace { class ForwardDeclare3; } ...

2748	closed	theuni	Here is the first go at an Autotools build system replacement. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the current system(s), providing the same features with no net changes. It can also live side-by-side with the old system while sharing the same build-related variables in order to facilitate a smooth transition. I hope the benefits are obvious enough: A single/shared build procedure, portability, ease of packaging, ease for downstreams, ease for repository maintainers, cross-compilation, etc. I dont vouch for Autotools in any way, in fact, this configure.am is downright ugly (mainly just because of mingw though), but its portable and well-established. Ive opted not to write the documentation yet, because I would like to see what comments/concerns come out of the first round of review before committing to anything. This does away with the need for qmake, as the Makefile is capable of generating everything it needs in a portable way. Qt-creator can be used with the Autotools plugin, and is working nicely. For those who wish to use it this way, install the Autotools plugin from the about menu, then open Makefile.am as a project. It handles the build procedure, so there is no need to mess with the command-line procedures listed below. Building from CLI: For Linux, assuming the dependencies have been met, the build procedure looks like this: ``` ./autogen.sh ./configure make ``` Same for OS X, but the pkg-config path needs to be hooked up from macports first: ``` echo "/opt/local/share/aclocal" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/aclocal/dirlist ``` For mingw its the same, but you will need to provide lots of paths in the form of: ``` ./autogen.sh CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/include -I/path/to/other/include" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/libs -L/path/to/other/libs" ./configure make ``` In addition, there are helpers for qt and boost to help with finding some locations. Use ./configure --help to see the available options. Native windows built is untested, as I dont have a windows environment at my disposal. I have verified that linux builds are deterministic insofar as a fresh git clone will build bit-exact binaries to match another clean checkout on the same machine. To my knowledge, that means that gitian shouldnt have any trouble making the switch (after the descriptors are updated to use autotools). make check will run the unit tests and print the results. Ive done my best to avoid adding any new behavior or features, and I would much prefer to aim for feature-parity before making any improvements.

After some testing I found that most of the time was spent in EC_KEY_check_key The fix this I have merged two of the checks into using a single CECKey instance, replaced EC_KEY_check_key with a faster operation (thanks to sipa for helping me there), and appended a hash of the private key to "key" entries. On my system loading one private key took approximately 1500 usec.

The intro screen shows how much space is available on the device that contains the chosen directory and warns if this is less than the 10Gb.

2632	closed	mikehearn	Matt Corallos bitcoind/bitcoinj comparison tool relies on a patch that sets difficulty to zero, thus ensuring blocks can be found instantly without any delay. It also drops the subsidy halving interval so that can be tested and makes a few other tweaks. This series of patches creates a new CChainParams abstraction that hides various things that vary between main, test and regression test networks. It then adds a regtest mode triggered by the -regtest flag that disables external connections and uses the "insta-block" rule set. Also, the miner thread will shut down once it finds a block, meaning you can generate a single block from the command line on demand by running ./bitcoind -regtest setgenerate true This change is incomplete - some things like DNS seeds, checkpoints and difficulty transition formulas arent refactored out yet. However I wanted to get feedback on the approach before continuing, and the current code is useful even though theres still more refactoring to go.

2616	closed	vinniefalco	Ive recreated a branch representing the original LevelDB from which Bitcoin based its copy (it was version 1.7.0 from October 2012), and reapplied the commits from Bitcoin using cherry-pick. It stands in its own repository now so that anyone can use LevelDB with the fixes that Bitcoin applies. It has a reconstituted commit log so that it is a "true" fork from the original Google repository, and that regular Git commands will work. This pull request removes the detached leveldb sources from the Bitcoin repository and adds them back using "git-subtree", which retains the commit log for the entire LevelDB branch from which Bitcoin started its fork. Using this method it will be possible to both submit Bitcoins LevelDB changes back to the upstream (which resides on Google code) and cherry-pick or merge newer branches from LevelDB back into the Bitcoin code base. All of this was done using the git-subtree command (instead of git-submodule which I hate). The repository containing Bitcoins version of LevelDB is located here, in the branch bitcoin-fork Now, anyone can use LevelDB and benefit from the changes that Bitcoin provided. Hopefully, this will make it easier for Bitcoin developers to merge improvements and fixes from the upstream LevelDB back into Bitcoin.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2616	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2616/comments	2013-05-04T02:11:54Z	2013-05-30T23:43:20Z

The reason for writing this is preparing the code to more easily change ECDSA implementation (such as maybe my secp256k1 library at some point), but it seemed useful enough to try to get reviewed and perhaps merged independently of that.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2600	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2600/comments	2013-05-01T05:36:17Z	2013-05-30T14:55:25Z

It infers safe lower bounds on the birth time of keys based on wallet transactions, and only rescans the relevant part of the chain after importing. It supports keypool/change/unlabelled/labelled addresses, and restores those correctly. When inferring birth times, it takes crediting into account via pay-to-pubkey, pay-to-pubkeyhash, multisig (even when not all keys are available) and P2SH. P2SH scripts in the wallet are not yet dumped to the file. Ill need to talk to the other client authors about that first.

This is because fs::create_directory() fails if it is called on a symlink. This patch resolves the symlink and stores it in the path cache prior to creating the directory, ensuring that operations are always carried out against the correct location and work as expected. SIDE-EFFECT: Because the fully resolved path is stored in the path cache any error messages that are returned which include the path now show the canonical (i.e. resolved) path. I think that this makes more sense for users and developers, however if this is not desired it would be possible (albeit somewhat more expensive) to only use the canonical path for the create_directory() call and leave the path unresolved elsewhere.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2590	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2590/comments	2013-04-29T11:11:01Z	2013-10-21T01:43:50Z

2577	closed	gavinandresen	This is a quick, safe fix for transaction fee handling. A riskier, more complicated fix still needs to happen, but will take more time to code/test/etc. Two motivations for this pull: First, to discourage people from bloating users wallets and the UTXO set with tiny outputs. This pull defines uneconomic dust as 54.3 uBTC (5430 satoshis, about $0.007 at current prices), and treats any transaction with outputs less than 5430 satoshis as non-standard (wont be relayed, wont be mined). 5430 satoshis is derived from the cost (in fees) to spend a TxOut/TxIn. See for proportion of recent outputs this will (eventually) affect. Second, we have no idea what will happen to Bitcoin prices or transaction volume / competition for space in blocks. So this patch lets users and miners specify the minimum transaction fees at startup, using the -mintxfee / -mintxrelayfee options (which Im intentionally leaving undocumented for now). The dust/nonstandard test is based on the -mintxrelayfee. Qt and RPC both now tell the user why CreateTransaction fails, if it fails; Qt error reporting is a little wonky (try to send one satoshi, and you get two modal dialog boxes, one after the other; I dont care enough to try to fix that). Note: I spent several hours trying, and failing, to create unit tests for this patch; CWallet::fFileBacked is ignored by several of the wallet routines used by CWallet::CreateNewTransaction. In the end, I decided thatrefactoring CWallet to support unit testing would be much more extensive and riskier than these changes.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2577	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2577/comments	2013-04-26T14:35:58Z	2013-05-04T17:15:39Z

2479	closed	brandondahler	This is a first-pass change to begin resolving issues and #273, #1958, #2412. I doubt this change completely ready, I intend on using this request for feedback on the current implementation of code and usage. ____ ## Basic Allow users to set bandwidth limits on overall egress and/or command-specific egress bandwdith. Overall egress bandwidth and command-specific egress bandwidth counts are saved to disk (currently every packet queued), to allow counts to be saved across runnings of the bitcoin node. A simplified cron-expression is used to determine when to reset all bandwidth counts. The cron-expression will cause start and reset times to "snap" to the closest values above and below the current time. This allows exact control over when the bandwidth usage is reset via the expression, instead of relying on the time the program was last started or other arbitrary limitations. ____ ## Configuration options For command-line (prepend -) or configuration file: * bandwidthsentmax - Overall egress bandwidth limit * bandwidthsentmax_[command] - Command-specific bandwidth limit * bandwidthresettimes - Cron-expression used to reset bandwidth counts ____ ## Formats * Bandwidth - As regular expression /[0-9]+[BbKkMmGgTtPp]?[Bb]?/ - Valid for any values 0 - 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes (16,384 Peta-bytes) * Cron - See [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression) for full cron expressions. Numerical representations allowed only. Special characters implemented: asterisk (*), slash (/) (with caveats), comma (,), and hyphen (-). Slash requires the end value be landed upon (which means */4 requires the possible range be divisible by 4). ____ ## Sample configuration Bitcoin.conf ```` # minutes hours dayOfMonth Month dayOfWeek # Resets each month # 0 0 1 * * # # Reset every sunday # * * * * 0 # Resets each minute # * * * * * # # Resets every 5 minutes # */5 * * * * bandwidthresettimes=0 0 0 * * # Only allow 2 GByte of sent data bandwidthsentmax=2G # Only send out 1 GByte of sent "block" commands bandwidthsentmax_block=1G ```` ____ ## Files this change-set: ### New #### bandwidthman.h and bandwdithman.cpp * New class to handle bandwidth management as needed, will serve a larger purpose as bandwidth management features are expanded. * Public functions * LoadConfiguration() - Uses mapArgs to read reset time cron expression, uses mapArgs to read overall bandwidth cap and specific command bandwidth caps. * TestScheduling(string strCronLine, struct tm tmTestTime) - Parses a given cron expression and uses a specific time to calculate start time and reset time. Used only by the unit tester. * AllowSendCommand(string strCommand, int nSize) - Determines if strCommand should be sent, given the command is nSize. #### tests/bandwidthman_tests.cpp * Contains unit tests for the calculation of start times and reset times used by the CBandwidthMan class. ### Changed #### db.h * Rename CAddrDB to CDatDB and make abstract, generalize specific functions to globally applicable functions, consider the general format used by CAddrDB as being a ".dat" file. * Create templated wrapper for new CDatDB named CSerialDatDB. Extends CDatDB and allows for any serializable type to be used as the template type. * Create CAddrDB by making it an alias of CSerialDatDB<CAddrMan>, construct the CSerialDatDB with the static filename of "peers.dat" (as previously hard-coded). * Create CBandwidthDB by making it an alias of CSerialDatDB<CBandwidthMan>, construct CSerialDatDB with the static filename of "bandwidth.dat". Note: All changes to CAddrDB result in no usability changes. #### db.cpp * Change CAddrDB functions to CDatDB functions. * Modify write process to prepend message start and append hash due to change in serialization time of payload data (new lines 488-494). #### init.cpp * Insert new step 11: Load bandwidth manager. * Renumber old steps 11 and 12 to 12 and 13 respectively. #### makefile.* * Add objs/bandwidthman.o as new object #### net.h * Export instance of bandwidth manager. * Modify EndMessage to require the message name upon invocation and return success or failure to send message. * EndMessage will return false if it is not allowed to send the message as determined by the bandwidth manager. * If bandwidth manager does not allow the message to be sent, abort message. * Modify all push messages to return success or failure, determined by EndMessage call. * Success/failure result is not currently used but planned for use later. #### net.cpp * Add new global instance of CBandwidthMan. ____ ## Extra data While researching how to approach the problem, I collected command-specific egress data off of an unrestricted node that was on the latest block. [This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnpjY4_hVstbdHpqeVRXeFZDM1lydmdYdndaWGlLZXc&usp=sharing) shows the count and total bandwidth of each of the commands. I do not remember when or how long it took to collect this data, but I believe it was over a few hours with no local usage of the computer. The branch at [brandondahler/bitcoin branch bandwidth-test](https://github.com/brandondahler/bitcoin/tree/bandwidth-test) can produce a text file that can aid in plugging in your own data into this spreadsheet.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2479	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2479/comments	2013-04-07T06:24:57Z	2013-04-09T17:56:50Z

2373	closed	gavinandresen	I intend these three commits, applied on top of the v0.8.0 tag, to be the 0.8.1 release. The plan is: + A new checkblock rule, in effect until 15 May, that ensure only blocks compatible with old releases are accepted into the main chain (only blocks that touch 4,500 or fewer distinct txids are allowed). + A limit of 500k to blocks created, also in effect until 15 May. Alerts will be sent to pre-0.8 releases over the next two months, telling people to either upgrade or create a DB_CONFIG file so they can handle large blocks. After May 15th, blocks up to 1MB large will be allowed again. Tested by syncing the entire main chain and the testnet chains. A unit test is included, but it only runs if you download the 900K forking block (see the comment in src/test/checkblock_tests.cpp ).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2373	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2373/comments	2013-03-16T20:22:30Z	2013-03-19T21:18:20Z

2364	closed	Bobalot	More or less copied code from the -blocknotify and -walletnotify, but for all accepted transactions. Is there a good reason not to implement this? As far as i can tell any DOS attack will be limited by the rate limiting of free transactions and even then process spawn limits can be set on any unix system. As long as the script does something simple, such as adding the txid to a queue, then there will be little chance of the number of spawned processess building up. This is very useful to people who would otherwise have to rely on constant polling or centralised services such as blockchain.info websockets.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2364	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2364/comments	2013-03-13T19:31:08Z	2013-04-12T21:07:28Z

2357	closed	gavinandresen	The shutdown code has bothered me for a long time, with fShutdown and vnThreadsRunning and a bunch of ad-hoc Sleeps(). Reports of shutdown-on-exit bugs in 0.8 prompted me to clean it all up. This pull reworks the way we keep track of threads, using boost::thread_groups or boost::thread pointers. Instead of polling for a global fShutdown flag, threads now just MilliSleep(), wait on boost mutexes, or periodically call boost::this_thread::interruption_point(), and are interrupted using boosts thread interruption mechanisms. All of the cleanup removes 400 lines of code, and, I hope, makes the code easier to follow.

It does not, until now, copies to the old-fashioned X11 clipboard that you can just select something and paste using the middle button.

2336	closed	petertodd	Test every invalid op code, and add an explicit test for Gavins proposed format for provably unspendable/always prunable transactions using the 0xFF invalid opcode. Specifically any scriptPubKey of the following form: 0xFF {zero or more ops} Because the scriptSig and scriptPubKey are processed separately one cant even use IF/ENDIF trickery to defeat this. I also like how it says "INVALID" quite clearly as the first opcode. Ive tried this out on testnet with no issues. Unless anyone has a reason why this standard is a bad idea Im also going to raise the issue with P2Pool; currently they are the main producer of non-prunable txouts that could be made prunable this way. No code to actually do anything with this standard is included in this patch; that can be done later.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2336	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2336/comments	2013-02-24T21:54:50Z	2013-03-11T23:16:51Z

2312	closed	gmaxwell	This fixes test_bitcoin failures on openbsd reported by dhill on IRC. On some systems rand() is a simple LCG over 2^31 and so it produces an even-odd sequence. ApproximateBestSubset was only using the least significant bit and so every run of the iterative solver would be the same for some inputs, resulting in some pretty dumb decisions. Using something other than the least significant bit would paper over the issue but who knows what other way a systems rand() might get us here. Instead we use an internal RNG with a period of something like 2^60 which is well behaved. This also makes it possible to make the selection deterministic for the tests, if we wanted to implement that.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2312	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2312/comments	2013-02-15T23:36:32Z	2013-02-22T16:57:38Z

Thanks to Sergio Demian Lerner for warning that an attacker might try to mount a CPU exhaustion attack using OP_CHECKMULTISIG. This fix is low priority (post-0.8.0) because transaction fees are high enough to make a CPU exhaustion attack based on this economically irrational.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2275	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2275/comments	2013-02-05T14:47:32Z	2013-06-04T13:02:47Z
2273	closed	gavinandresen	Extremely large transactions with lots of inputs can cost the network almost as much to process as they cost the sender in fees. We would never create transactions larger than 100K big; this change makes transactions larger than 100K non-standard, so they are not relayed/mined by default. This is most important for miners that might create blocks larger than 250K big, who could be vulnerable to a make-your-blocks-so-expensive-to-verify-they-get-orphaned attack.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2273	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2273/comments	2013-02-04T22:17:35Z	2013-02-05T15:12:28Z

2241	closed	luke-jr	**Status**: Tests succeed, looks complete. This is based on top of #2243 (LevelDB build bugfixes). This is necessary for proper downstream distro packaging, and useful for people who have LevelDB installed for other reasons anyway. Undocumented to infer an unsupported status, but I could add a brief blurb if thats desirable. Only implemented for Linux (ie, not makefile.<not-unix>) for now - I assume OSX and Windows wont be packaging LevelDB/Bitcoin themselves anytime soon. Note that this does NOT remove the copied leveldb from the code, and will still build with that by default. **To test with system LevelDB:** 1) Optional: Delete or move src/leveldb so any attempt to use it errors explicitly 2) Install LevelDB on your system as a shared library 3) qmake bitcoin-qt.pro USE_SYSTEM_LEVELDB=1 && make 4) cd src 5) make -f makefile.unix USE_SYSTEM_LEVELDB=1 bitcoind 6) make -f makefile.unix USE_SYSTEM_LEVELDB=1 test_bitcoin Step 6 (test_bitcoin) will fail if your system LevelDB does not support memenv. This is expected behaviour. **To test included LevelDB still works:** 1) Restore src/leveldb 2) Remove system LevelDB library/package 3) qmake bitcoin-qt.pro && make 4) cd src 5) make -f makefile.unix bitcoind 6) make -f makefile.unix test_bitcoin **SIDE EFFECT:** Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind no longer include the LevelDB memenv module (only test_bitcoin uses it) - saves 423 KB	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2241	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2241/comments	2013-01-30T14:44:06Z	2013-10-16T09:17:02Z

2224	closed	sipa	The goal of this pull request is improving how errors during block and transaction validation are propagated, displayed and handled. It introduces CValidationState, which stores metadata about a block or transaction validation being performed. It is used to distinguish validation errors (failure to meet network rules, for example) with runtime errors (like out of disk space), as formerly these could be confused, leading to blocks being marked invalid because the disk space ran out. Additionally, CValidationState also takes over the role of tracking DoS levels (so it doesnt need to be stored inside transactions or blocks...). Additionally, some extra checks are introduced, excessive coinbase values are made a DoSable offence, disk space is checked before trying to flush the coin case, and read/write errors cause a fatal error (reported to stdout/GUI, followed by shutdown).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2224	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2224/comments	2013-01-27T00:53:25Z	2013-01-30T03:37:44Z
2223	closed	gavinandresen	At least one service that accepted zero-confirmation transactions was vulnerable because an attacker could send a transaction with a lock time far in the future, and then have plenty of time in which to get a double-spend mined (perhaps from a miner who wasnt on the network when the first transaction was broadcast). That is a variation on the "Finney attack". We still dont recommend anybody accept 0-confirmation transactions as final payment for anything. This change keeps non-final transactions from appearing in the wallet, and, assuming most of the network accepts this change, will eventually prevent them from being relayed until they are final.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2223	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2223/comments	2013-01-26T19:51:38Z	2013-01-28T15:56:59Z

When reconstructing the coins/ directory, it was connected normally. Beside being incorrect, since #2145, this resulted in a segfault at startup.

2188	closed	TheBlueMatt	This actually simplifies some SPV code, as they can keep track of a filtered block and its txn before accepting both in one step. The previous argument was that SPV nodes should handle the txn the same as any other free txn and then mark them as connected to a block when they get the filtered block itself. However, it now appears that SPV nodes will need to put in more effort to verify loose txn than they would to verify txn in blocks, thus making it more approriate to send the txn after the filtered block.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2188	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2188/comments	2013-01-18T18:56:23Z	2013-01-23T14:48:17Z

But do NOT ratelimit transactions added to the memory pool: - because of blockchain reorgs - stored in the wallet and added at startup - sent from the GUI or one of the send* RPC commands (CWallet::CommitTransaction) The limit-free-transactions code really should be a method on CNode, with counters per-peer.

This broke the UI and caused it to display %n in place of the actual number. In addition the previous calculation would display "Open for 0 blocks" when the block height was such that the next block created would finalize the transaction. Inserted the word "more" and changed the calculation so that the last message would be "Open for 1 more block" to better match user expectations.

2154	closed	CodeShark	I realize this introduction is a bit long, so if you dont feel like reading skip to the bullet points below under "strategy". The codebase as it exists right now has a number of unnecessary dependencies which makes code modularization much more difficult. In particular, the satoshi client was built to handle all bitcoin-related tasks, but its value as a "reference implementation" lies primarily in doing verification and acting as a relay agent as these are the most essential tasks that participating nodes must perform to keeping the network in operation. Things like wallets, historical databases, mining, and notification agents could be written as entirely separate third-party applications without risk to the networks fundamental integrity. The basic architecture of a bitcoin node is as follows: At the core there exist fundamental bitcoin message structures, along with the code necessary for serialization/deserialization. These structures belong in their own source files with minimal dependencies so they can be reused for applications that neednt perform verification and relay - for instance, filtering and notification agents. Unfortunately, these core structures currently reside for the most part in main.h/main.cpp, one of the central problems this pull request attempts to fix. On top of these core structures sits a network component that manages sockets, does peer discovery, and handles queueing and dispatching of messages. This component is clearly dependent on the core message structures but does not depend on the specific logic used to verify blocks and transactions nor to identify misbehaving peers nor sign transactions nor maintain a block chain database. Then we have a scripting engine, signature verification component, and a signing component. Historical database applications do not need signature verification/signing functionality at all. Filtering messages and sending alerts generally does not even require a scripting engine and does fine with basic pattern matching. The most critical high-level operations needed by a verification/relay node such as the satoshi client are transaction verification; block chain and memory pool management; and detection/management of misbehaving peers. These things are currently primarily implemented in main.h/main.cpp. These are indeed the main operations of the satoshi client - but the core low-level structures should not depend at all on this logic. Then theres the UI, but lets leave that aside for a moment. Finally theres init.h/init.cpp, which sets up the particular environment in which the satoshi client runs. <b>This branch takes the following strategy:</b> - Remove source file dependencies on main.h and init.h by only including necessary headers wherever possible. - If source files depend on definitions in main or init, either move the dependent portions into main/init or move the depended-upon portions into separate files. - If the dependent source files use global variables or functions that clearly belong in either main or init, copy the value over to a class member or a variable with file scope in the dependent source or expose a registration function to set a callback. - If moving a core class out of main is impossible because its methods depend on variables or functions defined in main, isolate the methods that depend on main and either move them to another class that *does* belong in main or convert them into regular functions in main. It is important that all modifications made in this branch are easy to review and to test. This branch does not encourage rewriting things from scratch - only moving them and rearranging them in easily identifiable chunks. Furthermore, the focus of the branch is not so much on coding style and style consistency - but on isolation of functional units and elimination of unnecessary dependencies.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2154	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2154/comments	2013-01-07T07:18:51Z	2013-06-10T13:17:39Z

As levels 3 and 4 are implemented using an in-memory rollback of the database, they are limited to as many blocks as possible without exceeding the limits set by -dbcache. The default of -dbcache=25 allows for some 150-200 blocks to be rolled back. In case an error is found, the application quits with a message instructing the user to restart with -reindex. Better instructions, and automatic recovery (when possible) or automatic reindexing are left as future work.

In cases where the wallet builds a transaction with a priority that is too low to qualify as free until the next block, go ahead without a fee.

2121	closed	CodeShark	========================================================== A major issue many have faced in using bitcoind to build applications is the lack of RPC support for tracking transactions and balances without having to know and keep associated private keys in the wallet. Oftentimes one might want to watch other peoples transactions or to keep signing nodes behind tighter security while using separate relay nodes to service all nonsigning, non-key-generating application functionality such as sending payment and confirmation alerts. In order to achieve these objectives, I have had to build a bunch of custom software - much of which duplicates functionality that is already present in the Satoshi Client. This pull request is an attempt at addressing some of these concerns without having to fundamentally restructure the client architecture. (Thanks, sipa!) The proposal is to add another kind of object to the wallet database - a bitcoin address sans private key - which the client treats as if it were any other wallet adddress except for when it comes to signing and privkey export operations. This means RPC calls such as getreceivedbyaddress and listtransactions can be used on arbitrary bitcoin addresses. Ive added an RPC call: importaddress <bitcoinaddress> [label] [rescan=true] The address is added as a new type of serialized object in wallet.dat and loads into the key maps of the CKeyStore instances with the key set to the CKeyID and the secret set to an empty vector. Please test it out and let me know what you think.

2042	closed	luke-jr	OpenDiskFile was always opening files in "rb+" mode (read-write binary), and if that failed and fReadOnly was false, trying to truncate the file. Truncate would always fail (AFAIK) unless a race condition set the file read-write between the two attempts. This changes it to actually honour fReadOnly. The truncate race is not fixed, and cannot easily be fixed (fopen lacks a "open read-write, random access, but dont truncate" mode). If we want to actually try truncating in !fReadOnly mode, Im pretty sure we need to unlink first.

2016	closed	jgarzik	Replaces CNode::vRecv buffer with a vector of CNetMessages. This simplifies ProcessMessages() and eliminates several redundant data copies. Overview: * socket thread now parses incoming message datastream into header/data components, as encapsulated by CNetMessage * socket thread adds each CNetMessage to a vector inside CNode * message thread (ProcessMessages) iterates through CNodes CNetMessage vector Message parsing is made more strict: * Socket is disconnected, if message larger than MAX_SIZE or if CMessageHeader deserialization fails (latter is impossible?). Previously, code would simply eat garbage data all day long. * Socket is disconnected, if we fail to find pchMessageStart. We do not search through garbage, to find pchMessageStart. Each message must begin precisely after the last message ends. ProcessMessages() always processes a complete message, and is more efficient: * buffer is always precisely sized, using CDataStream::resize(), rather than progressively sized in 64k chunks. More efficient for large messages like "block". * whole-buffer memory copy eliminated (vRecv -> vMsg) * other buffer-shifting memory copies eliminated (vRecv.insert, vRecv.erase)	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2016	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2016/comments	2012-11-15T22:01:20Z	2013-03-24T16:29:09Z

1995	closed	alexanderkjeldaas	A while back I started looking at bitcoin, and I was disappointed with the code quality wrt locking. I tried to fix the code to be clang -Wthread-safety clean, but I dont know the code enough to understand some of the entanglements that are currently present. Ive added lots of annotations that specifies the locking requirements on functions and data. This might seem a little overzealous, but I believe that this is necessary to "get back on track" and make the locking strategy clear and consistent. Even with this patch there are lots of locking issues left - probably benign like things happening during startup and shutdown. There are also false positives from me not getting clang to grok TRY_LOCK correctly. Below is a long note I wrote while looking through the source code a while back. Maybe you guys agree or maybe not - at least it explains the whats and the whys. --- For an object that is accessed by multiple threads we have, for every field: - It is const, constant after initialization, or guarded by a mutex. - Re-using an object is a *bad idea*. It should never be done. If we do, we are mutating the constant-after-initialization fields. This leads to exessive locking and overcomplicated code. It is a lot simpler to discard the object and re-create it. This works, because the object is owned by some other object, and in that other object, it is a "guarded by mutex" field. Thus by re-creating the object, we lift the responsibility for locking into the parent. - A result of the above is that "constructors" must be separate from other functions in the class. Constructors that are not strictly C++ constructors, such as deserializing should be static functions if possible. This makes it impossible for them to to be used to mutate constant-after-initialization fields. - Locks should not be exported outside of a class. Java did this mistake and it is considered an anti-pattern. - Locks should never serialize code, they should protect data from being accessed while invariants on that data are broken. - Locks should be textually close to the fields. Given a lock, it should be easy to understand what it guards, and given a field, it should be easy to see which locks guard that field. Thus, locks should be private members of a class. A good way to obfuscate this is to put a lock in a parent class, as done in keystore.h where CKeyStore. It is hard to know what that lock guards. It is a lot cleaner to duplicate that lock in the data section of the subclasses. - Recursive locks should never be used. They lead to bugs, and are *only* necessary in order to write sloppy code. If some functionality is both a transaction that ensures that the invariants of the data are obeyed, and part of larger transactions, then it is much clearer to separate these conserns into two functions: void DoFoo() { LOCK(cs); DoFooUnlocked(); } void DoFooUnlocked() { ... } - Using locks to protect simple setters and getters is often buggy and/or complex. In most cases, mutating some state is part of a larger transaction, so the setter is often protected by some other lock external to the class. In these cases, re-building a new object is usually the best approach, but otherwise, explicitly marking setters as SetFooUnlocked() and not lock is clearer. It makes it explicit that you cant just mutate randomly without doing some external locking. - Do not hold locks over callbacks out of an object. This means that objects should *signal* some state change, and not guarantee which state the object is in when a callback happens. Sometimes, it makes sense to break this, but then the callback will have to be treated like a signal handler, or irq handler - i.e. it can only do simple things and not call out to other random code. - Every time you call TRY_LOCK, a kitten dies. The reason why this is bad is that it makes reasoning, and testing the code incredibly hard. TRY_LOCK is basically this: if (rand() % 1) { DoA(); } else { DoB(); } It is simply unnecessary randomness. The TRY_LOCK macro should be removed, it kills kittens. If something like TRY_LOCK is truly needed, then at least it should be abstracted out of the actual functions, so that the functions themselves are testable. Thus in the above case, DoA() would be a separate, testable, function. In some really large systems (millions of large tps), sharding work queues by lock is a reasonable design to reduce resource usage by threads (so you do cs_someLock.DoWorkNowOrWhenUnlocked(&DoA), and it is more efficient than TRY_LOCK, but for bitcoin - this is just overkill. - Having lots of semantically different locks in a class is not ideal. For example CNode has 4 locks. This means that there are 4 sets of invariants that can be established independently of each other in this class. To put it another way, when you call a function on this object, it should work on a subset of the state, or it should hold all 4 locks. This suggests that either the class is a composite of multiple objects, and should be broken up, or the number of locks should be reduced. - We cannot compose multiple critical sections which all take a lock into a large critical section. After we have released locks, all checks that we have done are invalidated. Most of CWallet is just plain wrong and based on this false assumption. Locking is done in CCryptoKeyStore instead of in CWallet. See above "Locks should be textually close to the fields" for a reason why people confuse themselves. - There is a lot of convoluted code like this: bool result; { LOCK(cs_KeyStore); result = (mapKeys.count(address) > 0); } return result; which is equivalent to this: LOCK(cs_KeyStore); return (mapKeys.count(address) > 0); The destructor is guaranteed to run after the expression is evaluated. There is no need to over-engineer. Similarly, there is a lot of code like this: void SomeFunction(...) { something(); { LOCK(cs_something); ... } } or this: void SomeFunction(...) { { LOCK(cs_something); .. rest of function ... } return false; } There is no point in all the excessive blocks.

1991	closed	znort987	Add the fixwalletdates RPC When the client has been off for a while and gets restarted, new transactions are received via blockchain updates and get tagged with the current time, which bear little to no correlation with the time at which the TX was broadcast by the sender. As a substitute, the "fixwalletdates" RPC re-tags all wallet transactions with the timestamp of the block they are included in (if any). One minor downside of calling this RPC is that TX that were actually received via broadcast will see their "broadcast date" be replaced by the time they got included in a block. In practice, Ive found this not to be a problem. In fact, seeing all TXs tagged with the time at which they get included in the blockchain makes more sense : in a way, its the time the TX became valid, and if we have to pick one canonically representative time for a TX, first block inclusion time is better than first broadcast time.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1991	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1991/comments	2012-11-06T14:44:55Z	2012-11-07T21:02:43Z

1986	closed	jgarzik	Although in theory RPC API access should be locked down, there are occasions where cleartext passwords have been used anyway. HTTP Basic authentication remains, but a new default "Bitcoin" HTTP Authorization header is used. HTTP Digest authentication was considered initially, but that may require additional HTTP round-trips. The standard HMAC-SHA256 algorithm pair was chosen instead, with some additional stirring factors (random nonce, time). The HTTP server will accept Basic or Bitcoin authentication now. The HTTP client will attempt Bitcoin authentication, and fall back to Basic if that fails.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1986	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1986/comments	2012-11-05T06:38:42Z	2013-05-30T17:00:28Z

The client should hash the file locally then send a uint256 in hex form as the 2rd parameter to signfile and the 3rd parameter to verifyfile. The other option would have been for the client to hash the file locally and send it to the server using the signmessage / verifymessage calls, but then the server would be signing a hash of a hash.

Garlicat requires a centralized lookup service to map the 80-bit addresses to fully routable ones (as far as I understood), so thats not really usable in our situation.

1869	closed	maaku	This patch removes the disabled opcodes and the one dependent utility function that is orphaned. Interestingly there appears to be a slight difference in behavior between explicitly disabled opcodes and reserved/unused opcodes. Previously VerifyScript() would fail any script containing a disabled opcode as soon as it is encountered, whereas reserved/unused opcodes would fail when they are executed. This is a subtle difference, but detectable. Take the following script from the invalid-script unit tests: 0 IF INVERT ELSE 1 ENDIF This previously failed even though the INVERT is never executed. But now that the disabled opcodes are removed entirely, INVERT becomes 0x83 and is treated like any other unused opcode, meaning that script now passes validation. To fail, the IF-branch of the conditional would have to be taken: 1 IF 0x83 ELSE 1 ENDIF The last commit of this pull request simply switches the branch taken in this and other unit tests such that the opcode is executed and fails. However the construction of the unit test clearly indicates that failure even if the opcode is not executed was the desired result. A decision still needs to be made as to whether this behavior should be extended to all reserved/unused opcodes.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1869	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1869/comments	2012-09-26T19:14:51Z	2012-09-26T21:59:16Z

1828	closed	roques	The base58 codec uses full length bignum operations for each digit and `strchr(pszBase58, *p)` to find the value of each base58 digit. Ive cleaned up the implementation by: * using bignum operations with word-sized operands * using a pre-computed decoding table * adding comments * getting rid of useless copy operations As with my other recent pull-requests I think Ive made the source easier to understand and the speedup is just a side benefit. However, I could not restrain myself and added a last commit which is a much faster version, converting 5 or 10 digits at a time (depending on `sizeof(BN_ULONG)`). Esulting in an overall speedup of over 10 times. If your prime interest is in simple code, please pull all but the last commit.

1823	closed	roques	The problem =========== `SetCompact` as currently implemented interprets the compact number `0x01810000` as `-1` instead of `0x81`, because it is implemented using `BN_mpi2bn`, which interprets the highest bit in the first byte of its input as sign and this is not compensated for. Currently this is not a problem as none of the bitcoin-implementations Ive looked at generate compact numbers with the `0x00800000` bit set. Many contain a matching bug in their compact encoding routines. Satoshi: * `CBigNum.GetCompact(0x81)` => `0x02008100` * `CBigNum.SetCompact(0x01810000)` => `-1` Defensive encoding. Decoding results in negative number with highest bit stripped. bitcoinj: * No compact encoding. * `Utils.decodeCompactBits(0x01810000)` => `-1` Decoding will lead to `Block::getDifficultyTargetAsInteger()` throwing a `VerificationException`. bitcoinjs: * `encodeDiffBits(0x80)` => `0x02008000` * `decodeDiffBits(0x01810000)` => `0x81` (OK) Defensive encoding and correct decoding libbitcoin: * `big_number::compact(0x80)` => `0x02008000` * `big_number::set_compact(0x01810000)` => `-1` Defensive encoding. Decoding results in block_work() returning 0 and validate_block::check_proof_of_work returning false. This branch =========== The first commit adds several test cases for `GetCompact()` and `SetCompact()`, including one showcasing the erroneous decoding. The second commit reimplements `GetCompact()` and `SetCompact()` using shifts instead of going through the MPI-representation. `GetCompact()` now is careful not to generate compact numbers with the `0x00800000` bit set (`GetCompact(0xff)` yields `0x0200ff00` instead of `0x01ff0000`). It results in identical compact numbers for positive inputs as the old code. `SetCompact` now interprets the compact number `0x01810000` as `0x81` instead of `-1`.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1823	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1823/comments	2012-09-13T14:38:18Z	2012-11-13T20:32:32Z

That isnt a problem for transactions that are in the wallet, but if youre giving the private keys to signrawtransaction then it doesnt look in the wallet, and there needed to be some way to provide the redemption Script. This pull request makes three functional changes: + Adds "redeemScript" to listunspent output, when listing a p2sh/multisig output + Adds "redeemScript" to signrawtransactions second argument (list of previous transaction outputs) + Adds a new RPC command, "createmultisig" that is just like "addmultisigaddress" but instead of adding the multisig address/redeemScript to the wallet, returns them in a JSON object.

The *.d cleanup in the clean target is needed for instances when you try and link against a bad db version (<4.8) but they shouldnt exist under "normal" circumstances. Should still clean them up. The swap of the bdb and boost include search paths is intentional. The openbsd port/package for db4 is stuck at 4.6 for right now and exists in /usr/local. Boost also exists in /usr/local so if its specified first you cant get the linker to find the correct bdb. Getting the unit tests working on OpenBSD requires patching the boost 1.42 port before building as the provided one will not work with any unit tests whatsoever. Ill write up build instructions for both platforms for a different pull request. Ive tested that this builds on both OpenBSD 5.1 and FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE-p4.

When memory addresses are 32-bit this is no problem, however on 64-bit architectures this is wrong. See also . Other warnings have to do with pointers, where %x is used instead of %p. I dont feel like fixing all the warnings right now, but it is a useful diagnostic nevertheless as it may reveal hidden bugs.

1784	closed	xanatos	I think that implicitly converting 3 (the number) to uint256, doing an & between two uint256 and finally comparing the result to an uint64 (the 0) is a little overkill if all you want is to check 2 bits of an uint256. I have to say the truth, Im not sure if now we would be comparing the "same" 2 bits or the 2 bits from the other side of the uint256 (looking at operator= and Get64 I would say the same), but considering what this code wants to obtain, it shouldnt be a problem. (Im not even sure if this code will be faster, but I do think that all those implicit conversions are b.a.d.). We could even do a (*hashrand.begin() & 3) but that would be quite unreadable.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1784	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1784/comments	2012-09-04T13:31:34Z	2012-09-04T15:12:09Z

1745	closed	gmaxwell	Dont force IRC off if not listening, do force it off if IPv4 is off. Previously Bitcoin would refuse to use IRC if it was either not accepting inbound connections or not making outbound. Instead this changes it to not use IRC only if its not doing either or if IPv4 is off completely. If Bitcoin is not listening this will use the default random nicks rather than the IP based ones. Also, Dont retry a failing IRC nickname forever. If our IRC nick is in use (because some other node thinks it has the same address we think we have) dont fruitlessly try to reconnect using that name forever. After three tries, give up and use a random nick. Either well learn a new local address from IRC and switch to that, or it was right and the other guy is advertising for us. This avoids a pessimal case where a second testnet node behind a nat is unable to get any peers because he cant get on IRC.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1745	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1745/comments	2012-08-28T22:10:25Z	2012-08-29T18:02:22Z

1699	closed	laanwj	Ive investigated issue #1462 and in my experiments, the memory allocation pattern with a many transient objects almost guarantees that after the initialization of bitcoin **only one** of the pages is actually locked. This means that most of the keying material can end up in swap. I considered two ways to address this: 1) A special memory pool (using boost::pool) of locked pages 2) Keep track of which pages are locked with a lock count I first tried (1), but it ended up non-optimal. boost::pool is very wasteful with tiny objects (in this case, char), as the minimum chunk size seems to be the pointer size, resulting in a blow-up of 8 on 64 bit architectures. As locked pages are a limited resource, this should be avoided. So I went with the second alternative. This solution is also easier to test than a full-blown custom memory pool. Ive added an autotester.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1699	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1699/comments	2012-08-22T09:50:41Z	2012-08-24T11:38:58Z

1677	closed	sipa	This is a rewrite of the block storage and validation engine. Instead of blkindex.dat (a database with block tree data, and all transactions and their spendings in the active chain), it uses chain.dat (only block tree data) and coins.dat (pruned txout set). These two databases together are significantly smaller than blkindex.dat (<200 MiB), and only coins.dat is actively needed during block validation, speeding it up significantly (15 minutes for importing 185000 blocks from a local disk file). Blocks are still stored in blk????.dat files, in the same file format, but smaller files (up to 128 MiB). To prevent excessive fragmentation, they are allocated in chunks of 16 MiB, and some statistics are kept about them. To assist with reorganisation, undo files are created (rev????.dat), which contain the data necessary to undo block connections. Block pruning itself is not yet implemented, but this makes it trivial to do so; all that is required is deleting old block and undo files when certain thresholds are reached. Also note that this block pruning mechanism is different from the transaction pruning mechanism described by Satoshi. This one does not prevent a node from acting as a full node. All commits result in a functional code tree, with succeeding unit tests. The first few add some extra classes, without changing actual semantics. "One file per block" and "Multiple blocks per file" form a refactor of the block storage mechanism, with related database changes. "Do not store hashNext on disk" only introduces a forward-incompatible change that simplifies the database layout. "Ultraprune" itself contains the switch from txindex.dat to coins.dat as validation data, and contains the majority of the changes. What follows are optimizations and other some improvements, that do not effect compatibility. There are a few TODOs left (see comment below), but Id like to give the code some exposure already.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1677	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1677/comments	2012-08-16T18:26:50Z	2012-10-20T21:49:33Z

1619	closed	mikehearn	This patch set imports the Google LevelDB 1.5 database, refactors the transaction database code a little and then lets you pick between LevelDB or BDB via a build flag (qmake USE_LEVELDB=- to go back). On test machines, LevelDB seems to be significantly faster than BDB due to the fact that the bulk of the IO work is handled by a separate thread. The main thread just appends data to the end of a log file when writing, and the IO thread then turns logs into sorted tables and compacts them together. When indexing the block chain Bitcoin appears to be CPU bound on Windows and Linux machines, even during migration when signature checking is disabled. On my SSD based MacBook Pro the performance isnt as good and it still seems to be IO bottlenecked, which is the opposite of what Id expect. This code instructs LevelDB to use a 10-bit bloom filter per block. This expands the size of the database quite a bit, but allows a reduction in disk seeks. I havent tested different bloom filter sizes to see what works better. It is an area for future work. LevelDB is statically included because: - Upstream is not widely packaged and the build system does not support "make install", so its annoying to link against - We need custom patches to make it work on Windows. - Its important that all Bitcoin users are running on a db engine tested by us. We dont want some fraction of the network nodes to be "upgraded" but still running on BDB just because of who built their binaries.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1619	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1619/comments	2012-07-21T18:47:11Z	2012-09-20T16:04:20Z

I created that testnet transaction by: + I manually created a raw transaction with six inputs and 7 outputs + I extracted the private keys (using dumpprivkey) corresponding to the six inputs + I called signrawtransaction six times to sign each of the six inputs separately, passing in just one of the private keys and using a different SIGHASH_ mode each time. + I called sendrawtransaction to broadcast the completed transaction.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1606	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1606/comments	2012-07-17T16:14:59Z	2012-07-17T19:38:34Z

1551	closed	TheBlueMatt	This adds SHARED_LOCK, TRY_SHARED_LOCK, and UPGRADE_LOCK to complement LOCK and TRY_LOCK. It implements the many-readers, single-writer model where any thread holding a LOCK excludes other threads from a SHARED_LOCK, but many threads can hold a SHARED_LOCK. Only one thread can hold a UPGRADE_LOCK, it can be held while others hold a SHARED_LOCK, but it cannot be held while another thread holds a LOCK. This should create tons of low-hanging fruit for optimization, even though it doesnt do any itself.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1551	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1551/comments	2012-07-03T02:52:35Z	2012-09-05T01:42:29Z

Two new RPC commands: * addnode <node>. Adds <node> the same as if -addnode were used. Note that it can take up to two minutes before the addnode thread runs again and connects to the new node. * getaddednodeinfo [node]. Gets the list of added nodes including whether they are connected and to which node they are connected. Or gets the list of connections to [node] given [node] is specified in the same way as with -addnode/addnode. eg: getaddednodeinfo dnsseed.bluematt.me [ { "addednode" : "dnsseed.bluematt.me", "connectedto" : [ "95.154.99.150:8333", "80.221.217.69:8333" ] } ] or getaddednodeinfo [ { "addednode" : "10.232.4.10", "connectedto" : [ "10.232.4.10:8333" ] }, { "addednode" : "dnsseed.bluematt.me", "connectedto" : [ "95.154.99.150:8333", "80.221.217.69:8333" ] } ]	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1549	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1549/comments	2012-07-02T19:19:53Z	2013-01-28T19:09:04Z

1546	closed	gmaxwell	Bitcoin will not make an outbound connection to a network group (/16 for IPv4) that it is already connected to. This means that if an attacker wants good odds of capturing all a nodes outbound connections he must have hosts on a a large number of distinct groups. Previously both inbound and outbound connections were used to feed this exclusion. The use of inbound connections, which can be controlled by the attacker, actually has the potential of making sibyl attacks _easier_: An attacker can start up hosts in groups which house many honest nodes and make outbound connections to the victim to exclude big swaths of honest nodes. Because the attacker chooses to make the outbound connection he can always beat out honest nodes for the consumption of inbound slots. At _best_ the old behavior increases attacker costs by a single group (e.g. one distinct group to use to fill up all your inbound slots), but at worst it allows the attacker to select whole networks you wont connect to. This commit makes the nodes use only outbound links to exclude network groups for outbound connections. Fancier things could be done, like weaker exclusion for inbound groups... but simplicity is good and I dont believe more complexity is currently needed.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1546	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1546/comments	2012-07-02T00:45:06Z	2012-07-04T02:51:08Z

This makes it costly to send dust spam, but theres an edge case. The attacker can send a transaction with 1000 outputs of one satoshi each. The transaction size is huge but the fee is only the base fee.

1526	closed	gavinandresen	This builds on #1525 (the framework for smoothly rolling out new chain/transaction rules), defining "nVersion=2" blocks that include the block height as the first bytes of their coinbase. Putting the height in the coinbase is desired for at least two reasons: 1. It guarantees that every subsequent block and transaction hash is unique. 2. It can be used to better reason about plausible difficulty for not-yet-connected blocks. The format of the height is "serialized CScript" -- first byte is number of bytes in the number (will be 0x03 on main net for the next 300 or so years), following bytes are little-endian representation of the number. Only blocks with nVersion=2 are expected to have the height as the first bytes, and the "must have the height in the coinbase" rule is only enforced if nVersion=2 blocks are a super-majority (75% of last 1,000 blocks on main network) of the blocks immediate ancestors. This pull also contains a rule to REJECT nVersion=1 blocks once 95% of hashing power is producing nVersion=2 blocks. That means the last 5% of hashing power who refuse to upgrade will get orphaned. All of this wont affect users/merchants at all, they will happily accept nVersion=1 or nVersion=2 blocks. I tested this with a testnet-in-a-box setup, creating a 100-block-long nVersion=2 chain and then making sure that: 1. nVersion=1 blocks were accepted 2. nVersion=2 blocks that included the wrong block height were rejected (I hacked a bitcoind to test that).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1526	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1526/comments	2012-06-27T23:47:34Z	2012-08-20T19:57:01Z

In addition to holding CTxMemPool::cs for a shorter amount of time, this makes it easier to parallelize CreateNewBlock() -- something already done in widely circulating miner-pool patches. The cost: memcopying the TX memory pool at each CreateNewBlock() invocation (each getwork / getmemorypool new-work request).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1489	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1489/comments	2012-06-20T15:58:40Z	2012-06-27T15:51:33Z

1439	closed	Diapolo	This pull is based on a discussion with and - introduce a new StartShutdown() function, which starts a thread with Shutdown() if no GUI is used and calls uiInterface.QueueShutdown() if a GUI is used - all direct uiInterface.QueueShutdown() calls are replaced with StartShutdown() - this ensures a clean GUI shutdown, even when catching a SIGTERM and allows the BitcoinGUI destructor to get called (which fixes a tray-icon issue and keeps the tray-icon until Bitcoin-Qt exits) The current implementation (current master branch) sometimes crashes Bitcoin-Qt (bad) and doesnt allow GUI object destructors do their work as we call exit() in Shutdown(), which leads to an unremoved tray-icon (as visible bug). Im sure we could remove some ``#include "ui_interface.h"`` in the modified files, but I was not really sure about that, so input is welcome.

1429	closed	TheBlueMatt	This is based on #1408 and gives a preview of the goal of the rebase as a whole. It provides a CBlockStore class to store the block chain and allows CHub to call it and returns data to CHub. If it gets merged, CTxMemPool will be adapted to call CBlockStore functions to get info on previous transactions, and a CAlertStorage class will be added. I would prefer to not do callbacks from CBlockStore, but I found that cleaner than returning a list of blocks committed (as each call to EmitBlock can commit any number of blocks) through many of the block acceptance functions and back to CHub::EmitBlock, buf if that design is preferred, its not hard to do that. In general, though CBlockStore effectively turns several CHub functions into NOOPs, I prefer using a CHub as a convenience class so that CWallet/P2P client dont have to know something about CBlockStore and CTxMemPool and CAlertStore, but only needs to know one API. It also removes the need to duplicate much of the code to deal with callback threads in the storage classes. Obviously this does little actual abstraction, but just creates the class and moves functions from CBlock, if it gets merged, things like mapBlockIndex will get moved into CBlockStore.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1429	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1429/comments	2012-06-06T23:57:07Z	2012-07-05T20:15:33Z

It only prunes up to the latest checkpoint as there is no undoing pruning, so chain reorgs cant undo transactions that have CTxIns that were pruned. Note that the pruning process with -prune takes a _lot_ of time with -prune (an order of magnitude greater than loading chain on my tmpfs-backed system) and eats around 400MB of memory to load the needed information into memory. -autoprune is much less resource-intensive, but the checkpoint has to exist before the given block is downloaded, so users upgrading will not be effected unless they use -prune once. You can also run IBD with -autoprune to prune at each checkpoint.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1405	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1405/comments	2012-05-31T22:26:01Z	2012-07-05T20:17:05Z

1382	closed	rebroad	...eer thats lagging behind. This ideally shouldnt happen, but it can and does sometimes, so this code caters for that. This code also becomes more important if the block download algorithm is changed in future (e.g. pull #1326, which is still in development), e.g. if and retries are sent to other peers when peers seem unresponsive, only to become responsive again later, by which time they are sending duplicate blocks. Obviously the unresponsive peers could be disconnected when deemed unresponsive, but my tests have shown its more efficient to give them a chance to become responsive again, (even though it does increase the chances of them sending duplicate blocks), and disconnecting them at that point. Future patches could identify the duplicate blocks before they are downloaded, by the block size (looking up against blocks recently downloaded and against blocks requested from the peer sending the block). Ideally theyd be identified by something more specific than the block size, but currently block headers communicate only the size.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1382	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1382/comments	2012-05-22T21:00:26Z	2012-08-01T16:41:03Z

1349	closed	gavinandresen	These 6 commits: 1. Implement an ECDSA signature cache, which should cut the amount of CPU time spent verifying signatures in half (because transaction signatures are verified before going into the memory pool and then again when the block is accepted). Please review that commit very carefully, since it is the very heart of transaction security. 2. Implement several "belt and suspenders" changes to prevent possible denial-of-service attacks involving sending orphan transactions (suggested by Sergio Demian Lerner) or transactions with lots of inputs. Tested by: - writing new unit tests, and stepping through the code in the debugger while running the new tests - running the new code under valgrind for more than 24 hours on the main network	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1349	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1349/comments	2012-05-18T02:28:04Z	2012-05-22T16:52:57Z

For really naughty txs, that DoS(100) it also reveals the peer that sent it, otherwise peer information is not revealed. (although there will be a pull request coming shortly providing a command line flag should peer information for all txs be desired). Also, free transactions are identifies in the output. Not particularly useful, but these may become a rare thing in the not too distant future.. maybe, maybe not. Apologies for the txnode variable.

1337	closed	rebroad	This pull is a subset of pull #1311, which many said was too big, and did too many things. It wasnt easy to break it up into smaller pieces as so many are interdependent. Anyway, here goes. Comments welcome. This pull adds a command line argument "-quietinitial", which is intended to make the "traffic" in debug.log less so that the block download progress can be more easily seen. Its off by default, and without using it, things look the same as usual. I realise that some of what this does can be achieved with 3rd party log file filterers, but some of it cant, and its mostly developers that use such 3rd party tools, and Id like to help enable bitcoin to be useful to less technical people too. This sub-pull, IMHO, isnt as useful unless combined with some of the other pull requests Ive raised (and am still raising, due to hacking #1311 into smaller pieces). I suspect the others will need rebasing depending on what order the pulls are effected. ho hum..! Heh... #1337 is a cool pull number :) Not sure this one deserves such a number though!

1326	closed	rebroad	Builds upon pull #1271, which fixes Issue #1234. This allows multiple peers to provide blocks, not just one. Up to 8 peers can provide blocks in parallel, thereby increasing block download speed by up to 8. Submitted for comments. I think ideally Ill add some more code to cater for stuck downloads, so it can give up and move onto another peer. Currently, itll only move onto another peer if the selected peer disconnects. It a peer took a long time to disconnect, then all blocks downloaded would be orphans until the missing block was eventually downloaded. Also, the "8" concurrent downloads is hard-coded, would people prefer this to be a configurable command-line option?	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1326	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1326/comments	2012-05-17T02:02:06Z	2012-05-18T08:11:29Z

1311	closed	rebroad	This change improves debug.log output in the following ways:- It reduces some duplicate output, and no longer needed output (which was originally added for testing). It reduces the verbosity of output during initial block download, so rather than showing every block requested, it summarises. Once caught up, the previously level of verbosity is restored. Information about the nodes connected are shown, and additional information about errors (particularly rejected transactions) are shown, with the offending peer alongside. Recent changes which add many lines, such as address handling have been kept in as this code is still relatively new - I was tempted to comment out various lines such as the "tried...", etc. Timestamps is now enabled by default. -nologtimestamps or logtimestamps=0 will disable this. Also, renamed AlreadyAskedFor to AlreadyWaitingFor (makes more sense, as can cease waiting, but cannot stop having done a past thing.)	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1311	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1311/comments	2012-05-14T23:08:27Z	2012-05-29T09:45:40Z

1307	closed	Diapolo	I observed this today and thought why does the debug.log open twice. It seems that my naming with on_openDebugLogfileButton_clicked() is somehow internally used by Qt. So we had a connect() which uses on_openDebugLogfileButton_clicked() on clicked() and the internal stuff, which resulted in that strange behaviour. After renaming the function to on_openDebugLogfileBtn_clicked() the debug.log opens only once, as intended. I stumpled upon this as on_lineEdit_returnPressed() is used in no connect and only the function declaration and definition exists.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1307	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1307/comments	2012-05-14T20:05:41Z	2012-05-15T05:18:20Z

1293	closed	jgarzik	Cleans up and organizes several scattered functions and variables related to the BDB env. Class CDBInit() existed to provide a guaranteed-via-C++-destructor cleanup of the db environment. A formal CDBEnv class provides all of this inside a single wrapper. NOTES: 1) Other db.cpp-related operations might be candidates for CDBEnv inclusion. This current commit was chosen as a good starting point, only encapsulating clearly-dbenv-related items. 2) Further wrappers may easily encapsulate remaining direct bitdb.dbenv accesses, though it hardly seems worth it. 3) CDBEnv is a starting point for easy cross-database transactions. BDB supports this, but bitcoin codebase hardcodes txn<->database association into CDB.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1293	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1293/comments	2012-05-14T00:23:03Z	2012-05-22T21:52:12Z
1292	closed	sipa	Luke noticed there was a boost/thread/* set of synchronisation primitives, separate from those in boost/interprocess/sync/*. Given that they do not need to cope with locks being in shared memory, they are different and simpler on some systems. This commit replaces all sync.{h,cpp} infrastructure by systems provided by boost/thread/*. So far, it seems to work well on Linux, OSX and BSD (the latter two required a workaround before, as the interprocess semaphores and condition variables used spinlocks - it seems the thread ones dont).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1292	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1292/comments	2012-05-13T22:53:47Z	2012-05-18T15:10:49Z

1282	closed	jgarzik	blkindex.dat stores all kinds of data, and as such, each key is overloaded to form a namespace. All keys beginning with "blockindex" form the hash->CBlockIndex data that is loaded into mapBlockIndex. This change moves mapBlockIndex data to its own database, custom tailored for the sort of data we wish to store: - BDB type changed from btree to hash - key is uint256 hash, with no prefixes Usage is cleaner, and uses slightly less CPU and disk space than the previous solution. COMPATIBILITY STATUS: A new block chain must be downloaded, or at least reindexed. As such, may want to delay this change, if other major database changes are planned.

The values are static once the program is initialized, so initialize pathDataDir once. GetDataDir() is renamed to GetPrepDataDir() to better indicate that it has side effects. Curious to see whether people think this is worth merging or not. I think it cleans up the code, and is ever so slightly more CPU efficient for most use cases.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1281	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1281/comments	2012-05-13T07:13:14Z	2012-05-14T19:21:23Z

1233	closed	TheBlueMatt	This is based on cblockstore and commits blocks in a separate thread from downloading/initial checking (in CheckBlock). It offers a nice performance gain over cblockstore alone. * pfrom->Misbehaving is now called in a callback instead of after EmitBlock as nDoS is not known until the block is committed. This could give us a bit more work to do from a bad nodes blocks, but should be pretty safe as the buffer is limited to 20 blocks by default (-blockbuffersize). * A setBlocksSeen is added which holds a set of blocks which have passed basic DOS checks (CheckBlock and the minwork computations), ie is the list of orphans + accepted blocks. This allows us to avoid cs_main locking when doing the duplicate detection in the initial checking * FinishEmitBlock callbacks are done in series and, therefore, CBlockStore had to be changed to allow for InOrder callback threads. Though FinishEmitBlock callbacks could be called out of order, this would result in a significant number of "orphan" blocks being committed before being merged into the main block tree, which is pretty ugly and inefficiency. * GetLastCheckpoint now returns a cached value instead of scanning mapBlockIndex each time. This is primarily to avoid a cs_main lock in the initial checking, but is also a micro-optimization.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1233	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1233/comments	2012-05-09T06:28:29Z	2012-07-05T20:15:42Z

1205	closed	laanwj	Gets rid of `MainFrameRepaint` in favor of specific update functions that tell the UI exactly what changed. - This improves the efficiency of various handlers (no unnecessary balance recalculations). - Also fixes the problem with mined transactions not showing up until restart. - As this finally makes it possible for the UI to know when a new alert arrived, it can be shown as OS notification. - New addresses are selected again in address book (was a regression in 0.6.1) The following notifications were added: - `NotifyBlocksChanged`: Block chain changed - `NotifyKeyStoreStatusChanged`: Wallet status (encrypted, locked) changed. - `NotifyAddressBookChanged`: Address book entry changed. - `NotifyTransactionChanged`: Wallet transaction added, removed or updated. - `NotifyNumConnectionsChanged`: Number of connections changed. - `NotifyAlertChanged`: New, updated or cancelled alert. These notifications could also be useful for RPC clients. However, currently, they are ignored in bitcoind. Also brings back polling with timer for numBlocks in ClientModel. This value updates so frequently during initial download that the number of signals clogs the UI thread and causes heavy CPU usage. And after initial block download, the value changes so rarely that a delay of half a second until the UI updates is unnoticable. **Second commit converts UI interface to boost::signals**: - Core no longer links to any UI functions directly, but the UI subscribes to notifications through boost::signals. - Signals now go directly from the core to WalletModel/ClientModel. - WalletModel subscribes to signals on CWallet: Prepares for multi-wallet support, by no longer assuming an implicit global wallet. - Gets rid of noui.cpp, the few lines that were left are merged into init.cpp - Rename wxXXX message flags to MF_XXX, to make them UI indifferent. - ThreadSafeMessageBox converted to void, no longer returns the value `4` which was never used	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1205	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1205/comments	2012-05-05T15:43:16Z	2012-05-20T08:53:25Z

The wallet file is always lsn_reseted. -detachdb corresponds to the old behaviour, though it is off by default now to speed up shutdowns.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1119	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1119/comments	2012-04-17T21:39:30Z	2012-04-26T12:20:57Z

1104	closed	laanwj	This pull request enables most compilation warnings (of -Wall -Wextra) and fixes them. I compiled bitcoin-qt with g++ and clang to have as much warning coverage as possible. Warning flags in bitcoin-qt and bitcoind build have been equalized. `char-subscripts` warnings were especially dangerous, as char can be negative, resulting in accesses outside the array and thus potential information leakage. Fixed this by adding (unsigned char). Ive left these warnings alone: * `invalid-offsetof`: Looked this up, and found We use none of the special C++ multi-inheritance and dynamic casting so using `offsetof` should be safe. * `sign-compare`: Theres just too darn many of em. These could be worth checking later, as wrong signed-unsigned comparisons can result in nasty bugs. * `unused-parameter`: Also way too many instances. And ignoring a parameter is no problem, usually. I have carefully seperated this into commits for each separate warning class to make review easy.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1104	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1104/comments	2012-04-15T11:52:40Z	2012-04-15T18:39:15Z

1039	closed	sipa	Issue #955 was discovered to be caused by users entering an *incorrect* password that accidentally (with a chance of 1/255) resulted in valid AES-CBC padding, which causes a decrypted secret of 45-47 bytes, causing a failed CKey::SetSecret call. In the normal case, a bad password causes an incorrect padding which is detected by the decrypt function. As the return code is not checked, the previously (incorrectly) decrypted 32 bytes are used anyway, leading to a succesful CKey::SetSecret call. So in summary: we didnt know we were padding by default, and hence forgot to check for the case of a failed padding, which apparently resulted in something of the expected size.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1039	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1039/comments	2012-04-05T00:10:36Z	2012-04-05T13:17:05Z

1023	closed	Diapolo	What I try to achieve here: - harden the URI handling / IPC server (i.e. buffer length checks use of IMPLEMENT_RANDOMIZE_STACK for the ipcThread) - log and handle boost interprocess exceptions where possible - make URI handling more usable / robust on Windows (and not worse on other platforms - needs tests on Linux OSes) What I achieved (running and verified on Windows): - its possible to start the client via URI click, if no message_queue file exists - if one exists the clicked URI is sent to the queue file, but doesnt start the client (call to try_send() in bitcoin.cpp succeeds and we exit there - currently no check if the client is running - ideas are welcome), the URI is processed after manually starting the client and is not lost - on Windows its now possible to use 2 client instances in parallel and the first started one receives clicked URIs, if I close one of the instances the one left will process URIs - URI length is limited to 255 chars as message queue message size is 256 chars max. What I could not achieve: - handle some special cases i.e. a BitcoinURI file gets created by a user and is placed in the boost_interprocess folder -> results in the GUI freeze bug, as the file permissions differ from what boost would set, when creating the mq file -> that causes a boost deadlock (https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6745) Some details: The message queue is not removed anymore when closing the client, as this causes massive handling problems on Windows with 2 instances and my former approach of stale mq detection. First try is always to open the mq file for a re-use. If this fails a new mq is created. This needs boost 1.49 with a small edit in boost/interprocess/detail/tmp_dir_helpers.hpp see: There is currently no need for any hard monkey-patches like #986.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1023	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1023/comments	2012-04-01T12:45:15Z	2012-07-06T10:15:50Z

1019	closed	laanwj	This is a grab-bag of commits designed to streamline the UICore interface. It contains various small improvements as well as code cleanups: Improvements: - Allow other threads to queue shutdown in UI thread (functionality in case of bitcoind is unchanged). RPC stop and encryptwallet will now work with UI, and this also fixes segfault part of #999. - update UI only when needed, instead of polling with a timer (core notifies UI using AddressBookRepaint / MainFrameRepaint functions) - This fixes the issue with address created using RPC getnewaddress not appearing in UI address book - use a messagebox to display the error when -server is provided without providing rpcpassword, this doesnt get lost like a message to the console (functionality in case of bitcoind is unchanged) - allow threads to request a modal dialog box for fatal errors, so that they can wait with shutting down until the user clicked OK (disk space error, etc) Code cleanups: - move QT_PLUGINS stuff to qt main file, where it belongs - move dummy translation function _ to qtui.h/noui.h instead of util.h - remove dependency for SecureString on serialize.h and util.h (and the rest of the knot of .h files) by moving allocators to new include file allocators.h - remove broken and/or unnecessary functions from qtui.h/noui.h, clarify names, and leave only one MessageBox function that can be used both from AppInit2 and other threads In principle, these commits are fairly independent and could be separate pull requests if necessary.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1019	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1019/comments	2012-03-31T14:03:17Z	2012-04-04T12:03:08Z

Removing log files before shutdown does make catastrophic database recovery impossible, however catastrophic recovery is only possible if you have ALL of the log files available (all since the creation of the database), so the only situation in which that is an issue would be a brand-new user running Bitcoin for the first time and then suffering a disk-corrupting failure before they shutdown.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/1007	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1007/comments	2012-03-29T13:08:55Z	2012-03-29T17:13:42Z

980	closed	Diapolo	Okay, so my former assumption boost 1.47 would fix #956 was wrong and boost 1.49 did not fix it either. It turns out, that I could recreate the error condition by running Bitcoin-Qt and simply switch of my PC. So there were the 2 orphan files from boost interprocess that cause the problem. I found out, that no interprocess_exception was thrown, not in qtipcserver.cpp and not in bitcoin.cpp. Next step was to look through the code and the "create_or_open" option in the message_queue constructor got my attention. I changed this to create_only and voila there was an exception I could work with. It sais "file already exists", which makes sens as there are those orphan files left. In the end I introduced a new ipcRecover() function, which is called after catching interprocess::already_exists_error. This function works with the path were the stale message queue file "BitcoinURL" resides and checks if the file is there and tries to remove it. If that succeeds the function returns true and ipcInit() is called again. If this fails an error is written to the debug.log. Test case with 1.47 boost libs: - kill running Bitcoin-Qt instance by switching PC of - check for stale files, which are there - starting the client again with the fix disabled in the code - no exception, no log entries and a frozen GUI - starting the client again with fix enabled results in a not frozen GUI and normal client operation Log: ipcInit - boost interprocess exception #9: File exists. ipcRecover - old message queue found, trying to remove C:\ProgramData\boost_interprocess\BitcoinURL ...success I know there are many commits in here, so I would suggest to first only look at the diff and if you are interested in the history of the fix take a look at the commits itself.

962	closed	Diapolo	old behaviour: - if -maxconnections is 0 or negative, no connection to the network was established at all - the maximum number of connections was in range 0 to 8 (125 was unused) new behavior: - if -maxconnections is 0 or negative, MIN_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS will be used to ensure connectivity - if -maxconnections is unset Gavins intended default of 125 is used - if -maxconnections is > MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS, MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS is used Perhaps the value of MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS and MIN_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS should be refined further. I tested the changes on Windows and can confirm they work. Oh and I think this "bug" or lets say strange behaviour was introduced by Gavins commit to set defaults to 125.

It appears impossible to implement this functionality in Qt without breaking in some OS, or some combination, or breaking something else. And I wasted too much time on it. Ive tried four different implementations at least. If someone has a perfect implementation that works on all OSes *and feels like testing it extensively* then be my guest and submit a new implementation as pull request.

959	closed	rebroad	As the Loading of the Block Index can take several minutes, its possible the user might want to exit the process during this, and so far the only way was with a kill -9. This small change allows the Block Index Loading to watch out for a requested exit, and abort during the process. Its been tested on my computer so far. Without this change: the bitcoin-qt process is unkillable (without a kill -9) during the initial Loading of the Block Index. This goes against standards for processes, which should try to exit cleanly as soon as a kill signal is sent.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/959	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/959/comments	2012-03-20T16:34:21Z	2012-04-19T11:33:04Z

949	closed	laanwj	I spent some time today trying to get Bitcoin to compile with MSVC2010. Eventually got it to work nicely. Ill publish the solution and build files this week. However there were quite some surprises: - Define `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` in serialize.h to prevent winsock compile errors. - CService::SetPort, was mysterious unresolved external. Turned out to be a macro issue, windows defines SetPort - strprintf problem: - works in g++, but in MSVC causes horrible crashes. - `NOMINMAX` needs to be defined before include of windows.h to prevent windows from defining min and max macros, and std::min and std::max from causing compile errors - `pid_t` needs to be defined for compatibility All these are fixed in this patch. The changes are trivial. This still builds in Linux, however I still need to test whether this doesnt break the gitian cross-compile.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/949	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/949/comments	2012-03-18T22:58:08Z	2012-04-03T18:35:33Z
948	closed	sipa	In cases of very large reorganisations (hundreds of blocks), a situation may appear where an inv is sent as response to a getblocks, but the last block mentioned in the inv is already known to the receiver node. However, the supplying node uses a request for this last block as a trigger to send the rest of the inv blocks. If it never comes, the block chain download is stuck. This pull request makes the receiver node always request the last inved block, even if it is already known, to prevent this problem.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/948	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/948/comments	2012-03-18T22:52:45Z	2012-03-21T19:16:28Z
947	closed	ali1234	Currently, if a node is banned for misbehaviour the receive buffer, vRecv, is not cleared and ProcessMessages continues to process any further messages already received from the node. Thus, if a node spams hundreds of messages and does not wait for a response, all the messages get processed, even if the node is banned after just a couple. This patch clears the receive buffer when the socket is closed. Perhaps it should be done in Misbehaving() instead? But it seems logical that we never want to process messages from a disconnected node since we cant reply to them anyway. EDIT: Two things I forgot to mention: Firstly, I found this problem in litecoin, which is being actively attacked by spammers. I dont know for sure if bitcoin has this problem. Secondly, this wont do much alone, because there is very little code to actually ban bad nodes. I am experimenting with detecting bad behaviour - ie adding banning code, and thats how I noticed this.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/947	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/947/comments	2012-03-18T03:09:01Z	2012-03-21T19:24:57Z

It converts the window to a tool window, but when it is brought back it is not converted back to a normal window, causing strange behavior (such as an ugly title bar), as tool windows dont get a ChangeEvent on unminimization. This implements the eventual suggestion from the Qt forums . Ive tested it on Ubuntu and Windows (XP) and it works there. Can someone test it on KDE please? If we dont manage to get it right this time Im going to remove the "minimize to tray" functionality completely (but not "Minimize on close" of course, because that works fine...).

930	closed	sipa	Sometimes a new block arrives in a new chain that was already the best valid one, but wasnt marked that way. This happens for example when network rules change to recover after a fork. In this case, it is not necessary to do the entire reorganisation inside a single db commit. These can become huge, and exceed the objects/lockers limits in bdb. This patch limits the blocks the actual reorganisation is applied to, and adds the next blocks afterwards in separate db transactions.

Ive tried to describe the technical motivation in each of the three commit messages. It uses flockfile and funlockfile to avoid thread contention issues. As best I can tell, those functions are available on most platforms, but I have only compiled on OS X. I have a test script which sends SIGHUP to the bitcoind process every 100 ms. Ive been running with that test script and this patch for the last few days and havent had any problems. In my tests, it behaves well during startup and shutdown too.

890	closed	gavinandresen	The main motivation for this was a lot of frustration because command-line, bitcoin.conf, and wallet.dat settings were interacting in ill-defined ways. Now GUI settings are stored in QT settings files; see ... for details on where. Testnet and main network have their own separate files (thanks The first time you run with this patch settings from your wallet.dat will be read and moved over to the new settings file (and the settings erased from wallet.dat). From then on, settings in the wallet.dat are ignored-- so if youre using --datadir and multiple wallets, dont expect the setting to be read/erased from the other wallets. The proxy setting is behaving badly (e.g. 127.0.0.1 is turned into an IP6-looking address), but Im 90% sure that is a pre-existing bug based on other reports of weird strings in the proxy setting with the 0.6 release.

837	closed	sje397	This adds a field labelled Immature in the overview section under the unconfirmed field, which shows mined income that has not yet matured (which is currently not displayed anywhere, even though the transactions exist in the transaction list). To do that I added a GetImmatureBalance method to the wallet, and connected that through to the GUI as per the GetBalance and GetUnconfirmedBalance methods. I did a small no-op change to make the code in adjacent functions a little more readable (imo); it was a change I had made in my repo earlier...but I thought it wouldnt hurt so left it in. Immature balance comes from mined income that is at least two blocks deep in the chain (same logic as displayed transactions). My reasoning is: - as a miner, its a critical stat I want to see - as a miner, and taking into account the label immature, the uncertainty is pretty clearly implied - those numbers are already displayed in the transaction list - this makes the overview numbers add up to whats in the transaction list - its not displayed if the immature balance is 0, so wont bother non-miners	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/837	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/837/comments	2012-02-15T12:23:40Z	2012-06-02T09:35:49Z

798	closed	gmaxwell	Help users avoid insecure configurations a bit by recommending a secure RPC password and increasing the incorrect password delay. This may open up a RPC DOS for users with exposed RPC ports and short passwords. Since users shouldnt have exposed RPC ports OR short passwords, the DOS risk is preferable to the compromise risk.

707	closed	gavinandresen	This replaces VERSION with PROTOCOL_VERSION (defined in serialize.h) and CLIENT_VERSION (defined in main.h). I also define CLIENT_NAME as either "bitcoind" or "bitcoin-qt" in main.h. The getinfo() RPC command returns CLIENT_VERSION as "version" (same as before) and PROTOCOL_VERSION as "protocolversion" (new). CLIENT_VERSION is recorded in the wallet.dat as "version". And PROTOCOL_VERSION is used for all the network serialization stuff. There is a TODO here related to the CAlert feature, but doing it will require more thought/work. And Ive got another change to CAlert (give testnet its own alert keypair) thatll be a good time to change it. I decided against new command-line arguments / bitcoin.conf options to make it really easy to override the CLIENT_NAME or CLIENT_VERSION reported to peers; those would be easy-to-add-later features.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/707	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/707/comments	2011-12-16T21:34:44Z	2011-12-19T15:25:16Z

Currently, the only way to do this is to require the user to enable IP transactions and then use the "checkorder" bitcoin P2P command. However, checkorder may be removed and using it is very clumsy. Background: Using public keys wherever they can be used is good for the bitcoin network. The total size of a txout and claim txin is smaller when using them, as the pubkey hash is never included and there are several less opcodes.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/676	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/676/comments	2011-12-03T03:20:43Z	2011-12-20T20:39:15Z

669	closed	gavinandresen	This implements BIPS 11, 12, and 13 : * OP_CHECKMULTISIG transactions supported, for up to 3 public keys, as standard transactions * OP_EVAL (same opcode as OP_NOP1) as a new opcode * New OP_EVAL-based standard transaction type and Bitcoin address * Blocks mined with this patch will have the string "OP_EVAL" in the coinbase scriptSig, so we can tell when a majority of miners support it. * New RPC command to add a multisignature-required address to the wallet: addmultisigaddress &lt;nrequired&gt; &lt;["key1",...]&gt; &#91;account&#93; (enabled only for use on the -testnet for now) * The validateaddress RPC command shows the full public key of addresses in your wallet * Internal changes so if you own all the private keys of a multisignature transaction, then you are able to spend the transaction (and the amount shows up in your balance, and the transaction is listed in listtransactions output) There is still a lot of work to be done to get multi-device transaction authorization or multi-party escrow; in particular, this pull doesnt include any support for gathering transaction signatures from multiple places or showing the user transactions that they are involved in but cant spend without getting more signatures from other devices/people. It just implements the lowest-level support, along with the bare minimum needed to test to make sure the lowest-level stuff is working properly. To test / play with: 1. Run bitcoind -daemon -testnet 2. Get public keys from 2 or 3 new bitcoin addresses-- e.g. run this twice: ./bitcoind -testnet validateaddress $(./bitcoind getnewaddress) 3. Generate a new multisignature address using the public keys from validateaddress-- ./bitcoind addmultisigaddress 2 ["...public_key_1...","...public_key_2..."] 4. Send funds to that address -- ./bitcoind sendtoaddress ...result of addmultisigaddress... 11.11 Step (4) can be done from another ./bitcoind, either on another machine or same machine, different -datadir, as long as it is running this patch. The coins should show up in the wallet, be listed in listransactions, and you should be able to spend them as if they were single-signature transactions. Step (2) could be done on two or three different machines, but without more work youll have no way to spend coins sent to the resulting multisignature address.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/669	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/669/comments	2011-11-28T22:10:12Z	2011-12-20T19:55:40Z

This makes casting between them impossible, so converting between the two at API boundaries requires calling ::c_str() for now. The lack of implicit casting between the two was a big advantage in making this patch thorough, since the build would break if not all the prototypes were updated. So it should also be a feature in making sure implicit casts (meaning gratuitous copies into non-locked memory) arent accidentally introduced in the future.

Compressed pubkeys have a different corresponding address, so it is determined at generation. When -compressedpubkeys is given, all newly generated addresses will use a compressed key, while older/other addresses keep using normal keys. Unpatched clients will relay and verify these transactions. Tested on testnet with both normal and encrypted wallets, using compressed and non-compressed keys.

This commit adds an English translation which defines the correct plural strings for the 6 strings that need them: ./src/qt/transactiontablemodel.cpp: status = tr("Open for %n block(s)","",wtx->status.open_for); ./src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp: labelConnectionsIcon->setToolTip(tr("%n active connection(s) to Bitcoin network", "", count)); ./src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp: text = tr("%n second(s) ago","",secs); ./src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp: text = tr("%n minute(s) ago","",secs/60); ./src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp: text = tr("%n hour(s) ago","",secs/(60*60)); ./src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp: text = tr("%n day(s) ago","",secs/(60*60*24)); says: "To obtain a more natural English text, you need to load an English translation."	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/606	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/606/comments	2011-11-04T18:59:50Z	2011-11-04T20:15:43Z
604	closed	laanwj	It took a lot of testing and experimentation, but these changes make the qt-win32 gitian build deterministic, and stop the build from randomly hanging on qmake in a loop due to time conflicts. They also shorten the build time and reduce library size by disabling more qt features such as OpenGL that we dont use. Hopefully, this is reproducible on other computers as well.

600	closed	TheBlueMatt	I know jgarzik didnt want this, but IMHO it belongs in the repo instead of (insert name of third party here)s repo. If the ubuntu/ubuntu ppa is to be linked on bitcoin.org (which I very much believe it should be), I would say its much better to have a debian folder in bitcoins src, even if it just sits there and only one or two third-partys update it via pull requests instead of the core team keeping it up-to-date. Note that this is essentially how the gitian scripts have been done for the past many releases, also just because a debian/ folder is here, doesnt mean any core devs have to deal with releases or the bitcoin/bitcoin ppa, it just makes the build process a bit more transparent and a bit more public. Anyway, its open for discussion.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/600	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/600/comments	2011-10-30T18:09:07Z	2011-11-04T07:40:45Z

593	closed	TheBlueMatt	This adds support for opening bitcoin-qt to handle a URL instead of just drag-and-drop URL support (which has been available in bitcoin-qt since before merge). Again it does not support OSX as you have to add OSX-specific URL handling and I dont have access to any OSX boxes to code that. This does add hooks to add Bitcoin as the default bitcoin: opener for Win32 in the nsis installer, also the bitcoin-qt packages in the bitcoin/bitcoin ppa on launchpad install gnome hooks for the same. Details: If bitcoin is already running, the launch of the second process will use boost/interprocess/ipc/message_queue to send the URL to the running process which will handle it. Otherwise the new process will launch to the send coins window. Because of this, if bitcoin crashes, links will have to be clicked 3 times before bitcoin will open.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/593	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/593/comments	2011-10-26T15:53:27Z	2012-01-26T18:09:00Z

541	closed	gavinandresen	This adds initial support for three new types of transactions: (a and b) (a or b) (a and b) or c ... where a/b/c are keys. These new transaction types will enable better wallet security and backup in future versions of bitcoin. Ive taken a conservative approach with this initial pull; the new transaction types will be relayed and included in blocks, but are ignored by the wallet code, so will not affect the balance and will never be considered available to spend. Im going to start a discussion on bitcoin-dev to do a bit of a brain-dump on what NOT to do with multi-signature transactions (there are several potential attacks that well need to be careful to avoid). Ill be creating a multisig_testing branch in the gavinandresen github fork that WILL add multisig transactions to the balance, will have a new RPC call to create multisig transactions, and will be able to spend the multisig transactions; that will be for testing this PULL only for now.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/541	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/541/comments	2011-09-29T14:46:40Z	2011-10-04T14:41:43Z
539	closed	laanwj	Some important (and less important) updates for the Qt UI Core: * use median filter (`CMedianFilter`) for peer-reported reported number of blocks * this fixes problem that one misconfigured or malicious node can mess up progress bar * implementation in `src/util.h` * testcase in `src/test/util_tests.cpp` UI: * Translation handling * Include translations as resource, so that they are included in the executable. This saves a lot of hassle on installation (less files to worry about), and is similar to how other Qt applications do it * In resources, use `nl_NL` format instead of `nl`, so that the correct translation is chosen based on system locale automatically * Improve send coins screen * Add balance to remind users how much they can send * No longer clear input when switching tabs; this is non-intuitive and can cause loss of work. Instead, add a "clear input" button. Build system (qmake): * Add `BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX` option to make it possible for distribution install scripts (such as Gentoo) to pass in alternative boost library version names without resorting to sed hacks * Factor out windows/mac specific include, lib paths so that they can be overridden (overall result is still the same) * Dependency library locations can be customized with `BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH`, `BOOST_LIB_PATH`, `BDB_INCLUDE_PATH`, `BDB_LIB_PATH`, `OPENSSL_INCLUDE_PATH` and `OPENSSL_LIB_PATH` respectively * Build translations (.qm) automatically in make, no need to run lrelease separately anymore Minor: * Add `Q_OBJECT` everywhere it should be according to Qt rules (removes warnings when lupdate parses sources) * Use `USE_DBUS` define instead of `QT_DBUS` to switch Linux notification mode, to prevent conflicts in some Qt versions * Update `OTHER_FILES` section in Qt creator so that all documentation is shown, now that both projects have been fully merged	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/539	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/539/comments	2011-09-28T20:22:18Z	2011-09-29T17:50:40Z
538	closed	tcatm	This adds ```(DEPRECATED)``` to both ```midstate``` and ```hash1``` in ```help getwork```-RPC. The idea is to remove both fields "soon". ```hash1``` is a buffer the miner should use to insert the hash between both ```SHA256()``` calls. It contains some bytes for padding. These are standardized in the SHA256 spec and all the popular miners have them hardcoded for performance reasons so there is no need to provide it with every getwork. ```midstate``` contains the internal SHA256 state after hashing the first half of the blockheader. This can be easily done in miners as they are already doing lots of SHA256 iterations and have probably faster algorithms than bitcoind. Deprecating these fields will allow for cleaner code in ```main.cpp /BitcoinMiner``` (i.e. only build blockheader without any hashing or formatting of buffers) and will make it easier to remove cryptopp from the source tree.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/538	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/538/comments	2011-09-28T16:23:35Z	2011-09-29T14:57:23Z

534	closed	gavinandresen	The attack this prevents: Generate valid low-difficulty blocks (maybe built on top of an early part of the block chain) and send them to a bitcoin node. Before this patch the bitcoin client could store an arbitrary number of them in memory or on disk, in case they later became part of the main chain. Two checks are added: 1) Blocks before the last blockchain lock-in are rejected, and the peer sending these obviously-not-part-of-the-main-chain blocks it will be disconnected and banned. 2) Blocks must have a plausible proof-of-work. It is impossible for a difficulty 1.0 block to follow a difficulty 1-million block (it would take at least 19 months for difficulty to drop from 1-million to 1). Blocks with too-low proof-of-work are ignored, and peers relaying them are disconnected/banned. Requiring plausible proof-of-work for orphan blocks or alternate chains foils this attack (you would have to be able to generate valid blocks near current difficulty).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/534	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/534/comments	2011-09-27T17:07:27Z	2011-12-01T20:42:02Z

517	closed	gavinandresen	The big idea: if a peer is sending you obviously wrong information, punish it by maybe dropping your connection to it, and ban its IP address so it cannot immediately re-connect. The probability of dropping the connection, and the length of the ban, depend on how wrong, and how potentially wasteful/damaging, the peer is. So sending an extra version message is a minor transgression that is usually tolerated, sending an more than MAX_BLOCK_SIZE block is a major transgression. Detailed how-it-works, using "I got a version message I wasnt expecting" as the specific example: Getting a version message from a peer increases that peers misbehaving score by 10, and (assuming that is the peers first bad behavior) gives it a 10% of being disconnected. If it is disconnected, then that peers IP address is banned from connecting for a couple of hours. If it is not disconnected, then nothing happens unless the peer misbehaves again; if it does, then its chances of being disconnected go up, and the length of time it will be banned increases. Misbehavior/ban information is stored only in memory, and information about misbehaving peers is never broadcast. Also, peers that are disconnected/banned are just dropped, there is no warning or reason sent. I think this will eliminate a lot of potential denial-of-service attacks, and could be a good framework for responding to other potential attacks. "We" should still look through the code and limit the potential size of any data structures that an attacker might target (transaction pool, orphan block pool); the DoSprevention changes are meant to make it harder for an attacker to stay connected long enough to pull off an attack. The danger is that I got something wrong; what if an attacker can leverage the DoSprevention code to split or shatter the network? Heres my thinking on that, please help check my work: + Im relying on TCP to prevent IP address spoofing (otherwise an attacker could force you to disconnect from your peers by pretending to be them and sending you a bad block). + Peers are only penalized for sending messages that wont, and shouldnt, get relayed. So an attacker shouldnt be able to poison the network with a bad message that is propogated and then causes everybody to disconnect from everybody else. + I specifically do not punish peers for relaying what look like double-spend transactions. If I did, then an attacker could try to segment the network into two pieces by broadcasting a series of double-spends from two halves of the network, and waiting until the nodes "in the middle" disconnected/banned across the seam. So: please let me know if or how Im being an idiot. Im still thinking about the best way of testing this; at the very least, running a node for several days with this patch applied should result in a minimal number of "disconnected %s for misbheavior" messages in debug.log.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/517	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/517/comments	2011-09-14T19:54:32Z	2011-09-26T13:06:17Z

492	closed	gavinandresen	This change skips ECDSA signature verification for transactions during the initial block-chain download, which makes downloading the block chain much faster. "Initial block chain download" is all blocks up to 120 blocks before the last blockchain lock-in point. Reasoning for why this is safe: If an attacker tries to feed a client bad transactions during the initial block-chain download (transactions with invalid signatures), then they change the merkle tree, and at the first blockchain lock-in the bad chain will be rejected. Transactions are still checked for orphan blocks that come in during initial block-chain-download (ConnectInputs will be called with fBlock=FALSE) and for mined blocks (ConnectInputs called with fMiner=TRUE).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/492	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/492/comments	2011-09-05T18:54:20Z	2011-09-26T13:21:14Z

One somewhat scary semantic change: Transaction times reported by in the rpc interface and in the GUI are now always the time the transaction was received by this node (and not the average-time-of-the-last-n-blocks-that-the-transaction-ended-up-in). Having transaction times change as they were confirmed was a mistake, in my humble opinion, but the main reason I changed this behavior was so that CWallet::GetTxTime() doesnt require the cs_main lock. Id like to further compartmentalize locking, but thats a task for another day...	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/480	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/480/comments	2011-08-31T16:46:51Z	2011-08-31T17:24:45Z

452	closed	jgarzik	RPC server will now accept and parse /api/v%d URLs. Any version other than one (/api/v1) will be rejected with 404 not found. URLs outside /api/v%d are ignored by this processing. Code heavily inspired by one of cdhowies commits from which I then pared down quite a bit, and changed the URL portion thereof. Credit for the base changes goes to cdhowie (from which I pared down and changed the code). The API versioning logic, as I understand it from the satoshi days, was that we should simply change the API as needed, because bitcoin is not yet version 1.0. HOWEVER, the logic continued, we should not simply make breaking changes to RPC API willy nilly, simply because we can. The value of the change must outweight the pain of the change, in other words. Thus, adding new RPC calls was never a problem, but _changing_ RPC calls was avoided. I like cdhowies approach sufficiently to think that there would be value in supporting "/api/v1" URL, to prepare for future versioning. Understand, this is NOT a blanket endorsement of pull request #431 with all its changes. This is only designed to add some future proofing in a manner inspired by pull #431.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/452	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/452/comments	2011-08-04T19:16:21Z	2011-10-20T05:58:10Z

I need someone to test this on *bsd and win32. bug fix 2) Change GetFilesize to use stat() instead of fseek() to prevent an integer overflow that would prevent >2GB debug.logs from getting trimmed on most (any?) platforms. This function is only currently called by ShrinkDebugFile which has been updated to pass a string instead of a FILE*. documentation update) Add -logtimestamps and -printtoconsole to -? output. This can be tested with: dd if=/dev/zero of=debug.log bs=$((1024 * 1024)) count=2048; tail -f debug.log & bitcoind -daemon; If logs get appended to where debug.log continues past 2GB it is working. Must be tested on a 32bit build. debug.log should also no longer be truncated on startup as that should be left to the user. This can be tested by restarting bitcoind after the fact and ensuring it is not truncated. The additional help output is pretty straight forward to test: is it there? :)	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/439	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/439/comments	2011-07-30T22:11:51Z	2012-05-18T15:12:09Z

431	closed	cdhowie	This is a two-patch patch against 0.3.24 (since master has a lot of churn in rpc.cpp and I dont want to do all the work merging until I know that this patch has community support). The first commit adds RPC versioning support. As things need to be changed, older clients still need to be supported in some way. This has been done by taking a numeric token from the URL and using that to determine the version. So if the API is accessed at `http://localhost:8332/` then it will use version 0. If `http://localhost:8332/bitcoin.v1` then it will use version 1. And of course, `http://localhost:8332/bitcoin.v2` would be version 2. For the purposes of versioning, I am declaring versions 0 and 1 identical, to avoid confusion. The second commit does two things: 1. Instead of requiring a JSON number, BTC amounts may now be sent as strings. 2. If the service is accessed using version 2 or higher, BTC amounts will be returned as strings instead of numbers. This is an important change, because not all JSON libraries store numbers in a format with 16 decimal digits of precision. Ive tested, and when I set bitcoinds paytxfee setting to 10000000.00000001, Python is unable to handle this many significant digits; it represents the number as 10000000.000000009. While not off by much, it does seem to indicate that representing amounts as pure numbers in JSON data may cause some clients to have accuracy issues. By taking the amounts directly from int64s to strings, the client is free to convert the values to whatever high-precision format it wants (like the `Decimal` type in Python). However, while many languages will convert strings to numbers automatically, many will not, so this change wont be backwards-compatible; hence the new API versioning feature. Here are the effects of this branch, using Python: >>> bitcoindv0 = jsonrpclib.Server("http://chris:testing@localhost:8332/") >>> bitcoindv1 = jsonrpclib.Server("http://chris:testing@localhost:8332/bitcoin.v1") >>> bitcoindv2 = jsonrpclib.Server("http://chris:testing@localhost:8332/bitcoin.v2") >>> bitcoindv0.getinfo()[ubalance]; 0.10000000000000001 >>> bitcoindv1.getinfo()[ubalance]; 0.10000000000000001 >>> bitcoindv2.getinfo()[ubalance]; u0.10000000	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/431	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/431/comments	2011-07-26T03:23:10Z	2011-10-12T21:22:59Z

427	closed	sipa	This commit introduces IPv6 support (selectable at compile time), General changes (even when IPv6 support is not compiled in): * Valid, routable IPv6 addresses are stored and forwarded * Name lookups are done using the general getaddrinfo() call * The detection system for the local address is improved. (addresses are classified according to their reachability, and the most reachable local address encountered is used). * The rule that no two connections to addresses within the same /16 should be attempted, was generalized by defining address groups: * IPv4 addresses are grouped in /16 blocks * IPv6 addresses are grouped in /32 blocks * Tunneled IPv6 addresses use the encapsulated IPv4 address (teredo, 6to4, SIIT, well-known prefix) * Hostnames can be given using the "[host]:port" format. * Support for the "checkorder" message was removed (obsolete, and not worth porting) Behaviour changes when IPv6 support is enabled: * DNS lookups also return IPv6 matches * The listening socket is bound to the IPv6 ANY address (::/128) instead of the IPv4 ANY address (0.0.0.0) * Connections to non-IPv4 addresses are attempted, using IPv6 sockets (connections to IPv4 addresses still use IPv4 sockets) * A local IPv6 address is used instead of an IPv4 one if no routable IPv4 address is available. In this case, it is not advertized through IRC (obsolete). For internal changes, see the commit message. Possible future improvements: * Some pruning/ageing of addr.dat * Cmdline/config options to modify IPv6 behaviour (eg. IPv6-only connection slots, preference for IPv6 connections, ...) * Intelligent choice of nodes to download initial chain from (avoid Teredo tunnels eg.)	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/427	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/427/comments	2011-07-24T11:41:23Z	2012-01-26T19:02:02Z

403	closed	sipa	Three commits: * The first one gets rid of the global mapPubKeys, by indexing keys by address instead of by pubkey. This brings a consistent interface to CKeyStore, and testing for ownership of a key becomes a call to CKeyStore::HaveKey(), instead of doing a lookup in mapPubKeys. * The second one introduces the class CBitcoinAddress - represented by its raw data bytes (20 bytes containing the Hash160 of the pubkey), but convertible to string representation. In most places in the code, the use of a strAddress or hash160 as address identifier is replaced with CBitcoinAddress. (CAddress already existed, so I needed another name) * The third one splits code not specifically related to addresses into a common CBase58Data	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/403	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/403/comments	2011-07-13T09:31:15Z	2011-07-24T22:38:38Z

394	closed	sgimenez	Im pull-requesting this so that people know this stuff exists. Consider it as low priority, and If theres some interest in it, I might keep this up to date for some time. Pluses: - Command line and configuration files are fully parsed before being taken into account, errors are reported (including misspelled or unknown parameters). - A nice interface is provided to access options & configuration from source code (cf. option.h). - Single definition of options and default values, which have been moved to the top of .cpp files. - Checks for integer overflows in configuration values. - New rpc command "reloadconfig" to dynamically update configuration parameters (Issue #309). Command line parameters will not be overridden. Notice that many core parameters are used only during startup. - Option -conf is now enough to configure everything (Issue #140). - A way to force listing of hidden options (-help=allopts) and access to help messages is possible even if bitcoin is already running. - Fix erroneous error message with respect to the path of the configuration file when using -testnet (Issue #241). - Removed \n and other data from translatable strings (Issue #313). - Using boost to deal with most filesystem paths. - Slightly faster access to configuration values (no map lookups). Minuses: - Access to configuration values are a bit less recognizable in source code. - Relies a little deeper on boost (but without added dependencies). - Uses some hacks around boost::program_options to recover original bitcoin command line style. Notes: - This has been tested a little bit on unix (linux), needs to be tested on other arches (Windows).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/394	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/394/comments	2011-07-09T16:43:03Z	2011-12-20T19:50:02Z

355	closed	pixelglow	When a process is polling bitcoind for new transactions, the existing RPC command listtransactions is not adequate. In particular, since theres no way for listtransactions to report all transaction AFTER a certain point in time, the polling process will necessarily have to grab more and more transactions and sort through them, or risk missing transactions if it uses a limit thats too small. This new command listtransactionsaftertime solves the issue. In particular, you use listtransactionsaftertime to get all transactions after a particular time (as timestamped on all transactions). A typical polling process can then grab all transactions after the last seen transaction time and be guaranteed a complete transaction log.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/355	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/355/comments	2011-06-27T08:45:33Z	2011-08-09T15:40:24Z
354	closed	pasky	These commits introduce CWallet::CreateExactTransaction() function that works like CWallet::CreateTransaction(), but takes explicit list of prev_out transactions for sourcing the new transaction and fixed value of transaction fee. Furthermore, new RPC call sendexact is introduced; it works like sendmany, but takes explicit list of transactions to use as coin sources, and explicit value of transaction fee. All outputs of the listed transactions that the account can claim are used to source coins; the output of the new transaction must be exactly the same amount, the user is responsible for dealing with any change. The user is also responsible for setting the transaction fee to such a value that other nodes will relay the transaction. The point is to provide a low-level interface for making transactions without all the auto-guessing implicitly done by the client. My primary motivation is that I am a control freak and I want to have precise control over the addresses used as "sources" of my transactions. There are other applications too - even if more specific interfaces might be more suited to them, this interface makes them possible at all as the lowest common denominator. E.g. people who wish to be sure no transaction fees will be paid for their transaction can use this interface. Or people wishing to try out different coin selection algorithms (or when coin selection makes sense at the moment of transaction setup, e.g. in case of anonymizers). Q: Why use explicit transactions instead of addresses? A: In reality, you do not quite transfer money "from" an address. Address is just a token that proves you are authorized to claim a particular amount of bitcoins listed as one of outputs of some transaction. Specific use-cases might be simplified, but you would still be in hands of a fixed coin selection algorithm. You can use (somewhat laborously) listtransactions or external service to discover transactions that send money to a given address. Q: Why use account instead of explicit addresses? A: First, it is more consistent with the other "send" interfaces and the wallet organization. Second, I believe account is the right abstraction - as mentioned, address is just a token for claiming some bitcoins, but different kind of claim proofs might be used (e.g. the now-deprecated "send to IP address", or it could be possible to also specify password-protected coins). In the future, you could associate further methods of authentication with accounts, but addresses are limited. If you require a specific set of addresses to be used, you can set up an ad-hoc account. Q: What does that bit about "change" mean? A: If transaction input claims some output of a previous transaction, it must claim all the coins in the output. If you need to transfer smaller amount than that, you must specify what to do with the remaining amount (change). The built-in coin selection algorithm either sends them to a new address (for better anonymity) or returns them to the source address. Here, you are responsible for manually specifying the destiny of your remaining amount. Q: Can I be finally sure I pay only the TX fee I specify? A: Yes, the TX fee you specify is final. However, please note that if the new transaction is large (i.e. has many inputs and outputs) or transfers too small amount and you do not offer any TX fee, it may not be accepted by any other nodes. Note that this is more serious than not being included in a block - you could just wait longer for a benevolent miner. In these circumstances, your transaction is not likely to even *reach* a mining node because the P2P network will not relay it. (If you like the feature, you can send donations to 19VF444umGxX76DZwPuWVMHpv7i84DHM1D.)	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/354	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/354/comments	2011-06-27T02:11:13Z	2011-10-05T15:58:05Z

349	closed	vegard	To delete the signature from scriptSig, OP_CHECKSIG constructs a new CScript object from the signature found on the stack and then looks for an exact copy of this object in scriptSig. However, if the original signature was pushed using OP_PUSHDATA and the signature is short enough to be pushed using one of the 1-75 opcodes, the two objects will not match and the signature verification will fail even though the values are the same. This patch fixes this by comparing the data-pushing opcodes payload only (excluding the opcode itself). Ive tested this with valid testnet transactions, which are verified correctly.

327	closed	laanwj	For my Qt GUI, I display a progress bar on first start to keep track of how far the initial block chain download is. This needs a conservative estimate of the total blocks in the chain. Currently, one such estimate is hardcoded into IsInitialBlockDownload as a magic number. This patch moves the magic number to a constant, and adds a function GetTotalBlocksEstimate() to retrieve the value (always 0 for testnet). According to the forum topic it would be possible to compute a real estimate based on version messages; this same interface could later be extended to return this.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/327	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/327/comments	2011-06-18T19:50:00Z	2011-06-29T22:30:43Z

Also, fOverrideTransactionFee has been added to allow the ignoring of GetMinFee() when creating transactions. Add setautocommit, reject transaction and committransaction. Here is the help for setautocommit: If <autocommit> is false, the send* functions will return a txid, which must be manually committed instead of being immediately committed. Once a new transaction has been created, you can get information about it by using gettransaction <txid>.

Furthermore, man-in-the-middle attacks are trivial as the internet has no "proof that you have ip XXX" API. In the future address shortening services based on "user@domain" would be useful, but these will likely be based on third party APIs and not on this code. * Removes logic to accept transfers by IP * Removes UI logic to send transfers by IP (CSendingDialog). Entering an IP in the send box will always result in an error.

Receive BTC, then when ready to spend them, use importkey in a running client. importkey &lt;file&gt; &lt;account&gt; Reads a PEM-encoded keypair from file and adds it to the wallet. To create a keypair with OpenSSL, use: openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -out NEW_KEY.pem -genkey Returns the keys bitcoin address. $ bitcoind importkey ~/NEW_KEY.pem TestAcct mt5M3Qa7fXsUV3bK6WtWTZEvXY2M1UPEgv Bug: Id like to safeguard against overwriting a key in the wallet with bogus data. Bug: I dont understand what has to be mutexed. Bug: Should do anything possible to make sure the imported key is valid. Note: I did not implement the corresponding export function, because my use case does not require it. I will be happy to implement it if this will improve the patchs chance of acceptance. Note: To make this convenient, one (I) would write a little script to read one of these PEM files and print a Bitcoin address. All key handling would be possible offline, and certainly in the absence of a block chain, until spend time. For my next trick, expect offline transaction signing and an importtx function.

232	closed	TheBlueMatt	This commit adds support for ekeys, or encrypted private keys, to the wallet. All keys are stored in memory in their encrypted form and thus the passphrase is required from the user to spend coins, or to create new addresses. Keys are encrypted with AES-256-CBC through OpenSSLs EVP library. The key is calculated via EVP_BytesToKey using AES256 with 1000 rounds. Each RPC command which requires the password in practice has an additional parameter, namely that password. Due to the need to convert the types of other parameters before sending them, users who do not use encryption (via the -nocrypt option) will have to specify a blank string (or any string) as the first parameter, followed by the command they currently use. Whenever keying material (unencrypted private keys, the users password, the wallets AES key) is stored unencrypted in memory, any reasonable attempt is made to mlock/VirtualLock that memory before storing the keying material. This is not true in several (commented) cases where mlock/VirtualLocking the memory is not possible. Although encryption of private keys in memory can be very useful on desktop systems (as some small amount of protection against stupid viruses), on an RPC server, the password is entered fairly insecurely. Thus, the only main advantage encryption has for RPC servers is for RPC servers that do not spend coins, except in rare cases, eg. a webserver of a merchant which only receives payment except for cases of manual intervention. Thanks to jgarzik for the original patch and sipa for all his input.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/232	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/232/comments	2011-05-17T23:27:01Z	2011-06-26T22:20:52Z

This push request is basic code plumbing, 100% no functional or build system changes. - Put guard statements around header files. - Removed macro foreach: conflicts with Qt4 keyword `foreach`, replaced with BOOST_FOREACH. - Prefix C++ stdlib structures and functions with std:: in headers; "using namespace" in header files is generally frowned upon because it infects other files included after it. These are moved to the implementation files. - Modularity: `base48.h` and most other header files can now be included without the other shebang (useful for linking external GUI to bitcoin core, part of GUI separation). The include files that need each other, now include each other.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/225	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/225/comments	2011-05-15T07:17:34Z	2011-05-15T16:57:06Z

If no block is specified, it will list all wallet transactions. The output also includes the block ID of the latest block on the main chain. This is designed to simplify the process of reconciling transactions it bitcoind with another database; you store the most recent block you have seen (the "latest block" result from your last reconcile) and, on the next reconcile pass this block identifier. bitcoind will then tell you about all the transactions you need to process (possibly including transactions you have already processed, if the latest block the last time you reconciled has since been orphaned).	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/199	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/199/comments	2011-05-06T16:22:09Z	2011-10-05T15:39:10Z

177	closed	jaromil	adding autotools for build checks, configure flags for compile time configuration and handling of #define directives inside code and things that will possibily make it better for bitcoin to be packaged inside distributions, as well ported to different architectures. this pull request follows my first sloppy attempt here: ive followed suggestions given by jgarzik, thanks for your patience this pull request is a rebase of this branch which eliminates all those commits and squashes them in this. the bitcoind code itself was never modified, just moved around, with two exceptions: 1) 9141f2c renamed cryptopp/config.h to settings.h 2) c929bae code namespace change: (int)VERSION renamed to BITCOIN_VERSION in headers.h so just one filename and one variable name changed, plus one #ifdef inside headers.h code modules have been separated in subdirectories and compiled as static libraries, still using libtool, which is the recommended behaviour when using autotools. a flag --enable-upnp=0/1 has been added and configure.ac contains templates for adding more compile time choices in future. as libbitcoin will be provided in future, ABI versioning is also ready to be adopted via libtool. the test/ directory is imported from gasteves branch for test units.

Valid examples of inputs : - wikipedia.org - - yourpseudo@bitcoin-contact.org - **Technical explanation** Input url/address is translated to an request sent to the corresponding domain (ip addresses are not translated for backward compatilibty). A valid response is a text formatted in json, containing a bitcoin address with an optional label : ```{ "error" : "", "label" : "Bitcoin Contact", "address" : "1NMxHnpAE38P9HN9pzRSqAFMCv1WcXZC1N" }``` GUI will propose you to add the returned address in your address book.

173	closed	gavinandresen	This is a single-line change that allows non-standard transactions to get into the transaction memory pool (and, therefore, relayed and written into blocks) on -testnet. Satoshi suggested this to me in an email, and I agree it is a good idea-- we should encourage people to experiment on -testnet with new features, or they will figure out less efficient ways of wedging what they want to do into the existing standard transaction types.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/173	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/173/comments	2011-04-20T15:28:25Z	2011-05-03T15:24:57Z

162	closed	jaromil	just a start, needs more detections at configure, however works to build the daemon alone for now. more flags should be present on ./configure to select gui build and detect required libraries. libtool is just used to build the internal libcryptopp, but we can ship libbitcoin.so in future. the aim of this fork is mostly that of GNUification for bitcoin codebase and process separation. code will be shared between daemon and client implementations via shared libraries. it might look as a traumatic for now, but well think of the long term... consider no code was changed in this commit, just moved around. win32 and osx builds can be fixed to work using autotools or a parallel cmake build. apologies for not having created a branch, ive pushed on my forks master. if that is a problem i can redo that quickly.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/162	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/162/comments	2011-04-15T22:47:22Z	2011-04-17T15:44:40Z

141	closed	jgarzik	While there is no hard consensus on what to do with CPU mining inside bitcoin, in general, I think most people will agree that 4way can go. This implementation (with performance enhancements) lives on in cpuminer. bitcoins 4way was only available on *nix, while cpuminers 4way works on Windows and Linux. I conclude that, if you are really serious about CPU mining, you are more likely to use ufasofts CPU miner, or mine, and so we dont need multiple implementations inside bitcoin.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/141	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/141/comments	2011-04-03T18:27:12Z	2011-05-06T12:08:15Z

125	closed	jhyslop	Added new function, OutputLogMessageF, which contains most of the functionality of OutputDebugStringF. OutputLogMessageF has two additional parameters over OutputDebugStringF: an enum indicating the context of the message, and an enum indicating the verbosity level. The existing OutputDebugStringF forwards itself to OutputLogMessageF, passing enum values indicating a log context "Legacy", and verbosity "Debug". Additional functions have been added to support the feature. These functions: - add and parse command-line options -logcontexts and -loglevel to set the logging context and log verbosity (respectively) - change logging context and verbosity programattically Several of the calls to OutputDebugStringF in main.cpp (which are hidden by the macro printf) have been changed to use OutputLogMessageF, to demonstrate how the new logging system works. I have not changed all occurrences (there are still 90 occurrences in main.cpp, and I havent even touched most of the other files). The change has been designed in such a way that migration to the OutputLogMessageF can take place as developers work on various sections of the code. The existing printf calls still work, and can be viewed by using the command line options -loglevel=debug -logcontexts=legacy.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/125	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/125/comments	2011-03-20T05:04:12Z	2011-09-19T12:55:34Z

117	closed	gavinandresen	Reason for this change: better mitigation of "penny-flooding." Behavior before this change: If you ran with the -limitfreerelay boolean arg set, bitcoin would stop relaying free transactions if it got more than 150Kbytes of them in any 10-minute period. Behavior after this change: Bitcoin will stop relaying free transactions based on an exponential rate-limiting function, where more transactions in a shorter period of time are more likely to be dropped (and the default average is to allow about 150Kbytes over 10 minutes). -limitfreerelay is changed from a boolean to a KBytes/minute rate; default is 15. Original code from Satoshi-- I added a couple of comments and allowed the rate to be set with the -limitefreerelay option.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/117	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/117/comments	2011-03-13T17:50:13Z	2011-03-15T14:01:17Z

I didnt want to make a new pull request but I couldnt find another way to do it. The last comment by tcatm was "This patch works ... outputs annoying errors (wx-config not found) when building bitcoind. Can you fix that?" I have fixed it in this branch (it no longer tries to include wx at all for any non-GUI files), and updated the readme to say its OK to use wx 2.9.1 now. It now builds bitcoind just fine even if your system has no trace of wxWidgets.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/82	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/82/comments	2011-02-25T22:33:31Z	2011-02-26T00:08:32Z
81	closed	mgiuca	I tried to build bitcoin following the instructions in build-unix.txt. I suppose I should have read this line: "The build hasnt been updated to work with wxWidgets 2.9.1 yet." Anyway, the makefile is not very robust in specifically including wx files directly in the INCLUDEPATHS and WXLIBS. I had a bunch of build problems which were all solved by simply using the utility that comes with wx, wx-config. This utility is automatically installed by wxs make install, and will provide the correct command-line arguments for including and linking correctly. I have updated the makefile to use these tools rather than hand-coding the paths. It works for me, but I havent tested it on multiple configurations. If it works for other people (and I figure it will be much more robust in the long run), then it should be merged. My branch also adds .gitignore, which I find useful.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/81	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/81/comments	2011-02-25T07:51:25Z	2011-02-25T14:24:22Z

51	closed	davout	I think its important that the "move" command handles subcent transactions without silently rounding amounts at two decimal places. It is common in a lot of cases to handle these small amounts (bitcoin central for example). I want to keep using it as a second security level on bitcoin central, but right now its not possible because the DB-tracked accounts slowly get out of sync with the bitcoin ones, and at some points transaction get rolled back because some bitcoin account does not have enough funds whereas the DB-tracked one has enough credit to complete the transaction. If I try to move 0.001 BTC between two accounts I get a "true" returned even though I should have gotten an "Invalid amount" with the previous round-everything approach since nothing would have changed. With this, rounding is only disabled for the "move" command.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/51	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/51/comments	2011-01-30T22:11:49Z	2011-03-03T02:43:22Z

It is supported by the latest browsers (although IE support is... different), and involves sending CORS headers in responses. Adding this enables Javascript code running in a browser to connect with any bitcoin/bitcoind that allows RPC connections from the browsers IP address and has the right rpc username/password.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/23	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23/comments	2011-01-07T17:45:28Z	2011-01-21T15:38:59Z

"multisends" (non-standard, use one transaction to send to multiple addresses) generate N "category":"send" lines. Bug fix: listtransactions wasnt reporting pay-by-IP-connection receive transactions.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/10	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10/comments	2010-12-21T18:50:52Z	2011-01-04T03:52:09Z
