A destdata tuple in the wallet is of the form (address, key, value) where the key acts to distinguish different types of generic data. The purpose of this is to give the GUI a way to store: - When an address table record was created (for #3207) - The invoice Payment URI associated with a receiving address (for #3207) - Outgoing payment requests (as soon as the GUI for this is ready), so that they can be associated with incoming transaction outputs when paid (transaction details could show this information...)

3276	open	sipa	Currently, the protocol processing happens mostly in main, while most of its data structures are defined in net. This leads to weird situations where they need to access eachothers locks, and it is unclear what functionality belongs where. This pull request introduces a main-specific CNodeState, which is managed entirely by main, so doesnt require CNodes locks. The intention is to move all processing-related fields in CNode to CNodeState, so ultimately main doesnt need access to CNode anymore, decoupling the two. This is a long way out, and well probably want to separate protocol processing to a different module than block validation, but its what we have now. For now, only node banning is moved to CNodeState. The reason for this is asynchronous processing. When blocks or transactions are processed by background threads, or in any way not directly the result of a single message being processed, we may want to attribute errors still to the original senders DoS score. Going back and forth between main and net for this becomes increasingly ugly, as this can be done perfectly well inside main. The direct motivation for this is an attempt at implementing BIP37-filtered-block-based fetching, and headers-first.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/3276	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3276/comments	2013-11-18T00:35:55Z	None

3088	open	gmaxwell	This patch eliminates the privacy and reliability problematic use of centralized web services for discovering the nodes addresses for advertisement. The Bitcoin protocol already allows your peers to tell you what IP they think you have, but this data isnt trustworthy since they could lie. So the challenge is using it without creating a DOS vector. To accomplish this we adopt an approach similar to the one used by P2Pool: If were announcing and dont have a better address discovered (e.g. via UPNP) or configured we just announce to each peer the address that peer told us. Since peers could already replace, forge, or drop our address messages this cannot create a new vulnerability... but if even one of our peers is giving us a good address well eventually make a useful advertisement.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/3088	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3088/comments	2013-10-13T22:45:20Z	None

3005	open	theuni	Addresses the last (I believe) work-item in Im unsure of the correct fix here, but I hope this can at least get some discussion going. This change at least fixes the problem on the surface. Heres the summary as I see it: Theres a mix of current-proxy-setting and saved-proxy-setting logic. Assuming the proxy is currently enabled: User unchecks the proxy checkbox, hits apply, the dialog checks to see what the new proxy setting should be, GetProxy() returns true because its currently enabled, check remains in the checkbox, user is confused. Logically (to me) it makes sense to be checking the setting rather than the current runtime values, as the setting should reflect what user sees on next restart. But there are plenty of other GetProxy()/SetProxy() calls, so Im inclined not to trust that line of reasoning.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/3005	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3005/comments	2013-09-17T01:00:23Z	None

2910	open	ashleyholman	This is a proposed solution for the "Fingerprint via weak-chain block submission" issue (#2757). Before storing a block, a check is done to see if it is at a height lower than last checkpoint. If so, it is not stored. (By definition, last checkpoint implies we have the whole chain up until last checkpoint, so we do not need to store any new blocks at those heights). A similar check is done before serving a request for a block at a pre-checkpoint height. If its not in the main chain, it could be a fingerprint block. There is no point serving this block to anyone as it is a fork from the checkpointed chain, so the request is dropped. Although fingerprinting would be possible by generating a block higher than last checkpoint, it would be economically prohibitive to do so.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2910	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2910/comments	2013-08-19T13:17:59Z	None

This can be easily accessed via command line cURL/wget utilities. The general goal of the HTTP REST interface is to access unauthenticated, public blockchain information.

2841	open	CodeShark	One of the most annoying things about trying to maintain wallet backups is the fact that every time you unlock a wallet the key pool gets automatically refilled, thus making any existing backups of the wallet keys obsolete. If you call getnewaddress on a locked wallet, no problem - but the moment you unlock it, your wallet backups are out of date...no warning is given to user. Sooner or later that backed up wallet will expire, by which time we better hope the user had the foresight, understanding, discipline, and memory to have made a new backup. As things currently stand, the user must either keep track of when the backed up keypool is exhausted and remember to make a backup before the new keys are used - or must make a backup after every few transactions to be certain the backed up keypool is never exhausted. And lets be honest about it - very few users do either of these things. They are tedious and annoying. I only do them because theyre far less tedious or annoying than attempting to recover lost keys. The user now has the choice to disable automatic refilling of the keypool by adding the following line to bitcoin.conf: noautofillkeypool=1 This effectively disables all automatic key generation, requiring the user to manually run keypoolrefill to replenish the wallet when the key pool runs low or a new wallet is created.The keypoolrefill command has been conveniently exposed in the GUI as well. This ensures that all generated keys can be easily and conveniently backed up in a timely fashion, with confidence that the backup has been made properly and will never expire without warning (at least as far as keys - synchronizing history and account labels are separate issues that this pull request does not address). We probably shouldnt be allowing users to generate new keys without prompting them to make backups (or automatically making the backups for them); certainly not in the GUI and probably not in the RPC either (at least not without requiring an override flag or an additional call). It obviously makes more sense to do backups in batch rather than after every single new transaction; after all, thats exactly the purpose of pregenerating a key pool in the first place. I believe hiding this from users only does them a disservice. Anyone who is smart enough to use Bitcoin-Qt should have no problem understanding how to do this - and anyone who is incapable of doing this probably shouldnt be managing their own bitcoin keys in the first place. EVERYONE should be making proper backups of their signing keys. Exposing a wallet backup function without also giving users control over their keypool is giving them a tool that requires two hands to use properly but tying one of their hands behind their back. This pull request simply makes the keypool feature which already exists properly usable. Having said that, with the expectation that some may disagree with my position, this new behavior is 100% opt-in - if noautofillkeypool is not set in bitcoin.conf (or omitted), the app defaults to its old behavior thus ensuring full backward compatibility. ![alt tag](http://blockhawk.net/screenshots/Bitcoin-Qt.png) View of Bitcoin-Qt interface with keypoolrefill feature exposed.

2412	open	jonls	Allow the network activity of the client to be toggled temporarily. When network activity is disabled the client will close all connections, stop accepting inbound connections, and stop opening new outbound connections, until the network activity is reenabled. The first commit adds this feature to the core, accessed through SetNetworkActive(). Second commit adds an RPC command "togglenetwork" to toggle on/off. Third commit adds further connections to the gui. When the network activity is disabled the status bar and the debug window will show this. In addition the commit adds a button to the debug window to toggle network activity. ![bitcoin-network-activity](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/420734/301091/75019bd4-95bd-11e2-91f2-c37c05891b31.png) Open issues: * Should the core close the listening socket or is it enough to just disregard incoming connections by closing them immediately? * Should SetNetworkActive() return an error code or can it throw exceptions?	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2412	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2412/comments	2013-03-26T02:33:14Z	None

2342	open	petertodd	Basically AcceptBlock() checks IsFinal() for transactions in a block with nHeight of the block being tested, or essentially nBestHeight+1 however CreateNewBlock() was using just nBestHeight, so transactions were being included into blocks one block later than they could be. Additionally the new IsFinal() test in IsStandard() had the same issue, as well as the UI. (ironically, a fix I wrote a few months ago, lead astray by simply watching to see when transactions got mined on testnet) The bug in CreateNewBlock() is especially nasty for fidelity bond sacrifice transactions, because a miner who knew the trick could collect all the fees for himself, one block before anyone else had a chance. (subject to hash power of course) Anyway, I should update the patch with unittests and investigate the issue more carefully; for instance, have there ever been any nLockTimed transactions ever mined in the main chain at the minimum possible block? Also, can the same logic be fixed for time-locked transactions?	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2342	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2342/comments	2013-03-04T10:22:01Z	None
2340	open	petertodd	Set nLockTime on wallet transactions (only, no RPC changes) such that they can only be mined by the next block, rather than a block orphaning the current best block. There are two reasons to do this, the first is the minor benefit that using nLockTime ensures related bugs get caught immediately, so protocols that need that feature dont become "unusual" transactions with flaky behavior. The more important reason is to discourage "fee sniping" by deliberately mining blocks that orphan the current best block. Basically for a large miner the value of the transactions in the best block and the mempool can exceed the cost of deliberately attempting to mine two blocks to orphan the best block. However with nLockTime youll soon run out of transactions you can put in the first block, which means they now need to go in the second. With limited block sizes youre run out of room, and additionally another miner now only needs to orphan one block to in-turn snipe the high-fee transactions you had to place in the second block, wrecking all your hard work. Of course, the subsidy is high enough, and transaction volume low enough, that fee sniping isnt a problem yet, but by implementing a fix now we ensure code wont be written that makes assumptions about nLockTime that preclude a fix later. Transaction propagation is not impacted; even with non-final is non-standard the best block height implies we have at least one peer, and very soon more peers, that will accept and rebroadcast the transaction immediately. ## Testing ### Unit tests Pass ### Propagation No issues. Used -blocknotify=bitcoind sendtoaddress to send transactions as soon as a few block is found with worst-case of a node connected to only two 0.8 peers. Enabled -logtimestamps w/ ntp on that node and another node, and every transaction got to the second node within 5 seconds. ### Services No problems: Easywallet, Instawallet, Coinbase Wallet, Coinbase Merchant Services, Blockchain.info, BitPay, bitfetch, localbitcoins Wont accept until 1 confirmation: Satoshidice Most likely SatoshiDice implemented nLockTime == 0 rather than IsFinal() as their never-confirm nLockTime fix. I think there is an argument to be made that forcing them to make a minor change like this one would be a good way to test the waters to see if theyll make a more drastic change, as would be required if we make dust outputs non-standard.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2340	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2340/comments	2013-03-01T11:09:14Z	None
2124	open	CodeShark	bitcoind now supports loading more than one wallet at once. A singleton object of type CWalletManager now exists. It handles dynamic loading/unloading and synchronization of wallets and allows different parts of the application to access wallets by name. A new CWallet* parameter has been added to the RPC functions. Functions which do not use a wallet simply ignore it. In addition, a new field has been added to CRPCCommand that tells us whether or not the function can be called on a wallet. Wallet-specific information has been removed from RPC method getinfo. Instead, getinfo just reports how many wallets are currently loaded. Detailed wallet info is now available via the listwallets method. Four new RPC methods have been added: - listwallets Returns an array containing wallet information. - usewallet \<walletname\> \<method\> [params] Allows you to apply existing RPC commands to different wallets. A default wallet named the empty string is always loaded and is used if calls are made without usewallet. Example: bitcoind usewallet foo listreceivedbyaddress 0 true (thanks, gmaxwell, for the idea) - loadwallet \<walletname\> [rescan=false] [upgradewallet=false] [maxversion=(latest)] Dynamically loads an existing wallet file wallet-\<walletname\>.dat. If no wallet file exists a new wallet is created. The default wallet file is always called wallet.dat. - unloadwallet \<walletname\> To specify additional wallets at startup, use option -usewallet=foo -usewallet=bar etc...as detailed here: and TODO: - Clean up I/O in CWalletManager::LoadWallet - debug, error, and UI output functions. - Check synchronization code. - Test mining functionality. Allow RPC mining on arbitrary wallets. - Integrate with Qt.	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls/2124	https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2124/comments	2012-12-23T13:30:58Z	None
